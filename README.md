# One-click-Tuning-and-Pruning-for-Customized-LLMs

ðŸš€ A lightweight, one-click solution for **domain-specific compression** and **fine-tuning** of large language models (LLMs).  
Supports **automatic pruning**, **LoRA-aware fine-tuning** â€” all in a single pipeline.


ðŸ“„ **Paper**: [All-in-one tuning and structural pruning for domain-specific llms (2024.12)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14426)  
ðŸ§ª **Supports**: LLaMA, Qwen, Phi

The **LEGAL** and **HealthCare** domain-specific datasets have also been uploaded together with the compatible dataset processing script.

We would finalize the code utilization soon.
