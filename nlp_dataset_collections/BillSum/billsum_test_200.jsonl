{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Border Hospital Survival and Illegal Immigrant Care Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: Immigration is a Federal responsibility. The Immigration and Naturalization Service does not take into custody all aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States. Section 1867 of the Social Security Act and State laws require that, if any individual comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide either, within the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition, or, if appropriate, for transfer of the individual to another medical facility. The Southwest border region is ill-equipped to absorb the expense of providing health care to undocumented aliens because it ranks last in the country in terms of per capita income. The Southwest border region has been designated as a health professional shortage area under section 332 of the Public Health Service Act . The unreimbursed costs associated with caring for undocumented aliens are severely threatening the financial stability of health care providers in Arizona. <SECTION-HEADER> REIMBURSEMENT TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE RENDERED TO CERTAIN ALIENS. Section 322 of the Public Health Service Act is amended by adding at the end the following: (1) The Secretary shall establish and implement a 5-year pilot program under which funds made available under paragraph (6) are used to reimburse providers for items and services described in section 411(b)(1) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (8 USC. 1621(b)(1)) provided in Arizona to aliens described in paragraph (3), and to reimburse suppliers of emergency ambulance services furnished to such aliens for which the transportation originates in Arizona , if payment may not be made to reimburse the provider or supplier under any Federal program or law other than this subsection , any State or local program or law, any group or individual health plan, or any insurance policy. As part of the pilot program, in a case in which an alien described in paragraph (3) arrived at a hospital in Arizona and the hospital provided for such medical examination and treatment of the alien as the hospital determined was required to stabilize an emergency medical condition (within the meaning of section 1867(e)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 USC. 1395dd(e)(1))), the Secretary shall use funds made available under paragraph (6) to reimburse the hospital for any transportation costs paid by the hospital to return the alien to the United States border, if the hospital requested the Attorney General to take the alien into custody after such stabilization. Such request was denied within 24 hours after its receipt, or the Attorney General gave no response to it within such period. And the hospital determined that discharging the alien without providing for such transportation might pose a threat to the health or safety of the alien . An alien is described in this paragraph if the alien is not lawfully present in the United States and not detained by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement authority. Or is paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USC. 1182(d)(5)) for less than one year in order to receive treatment for an emergency medical condition. During the period in which the pilot program is operating, the Secretary shall submit annual reports to the Congress on its operation. Each report shall contain at least the following information: The number of aliens to whom assistance was rendered for which payment was made under this subsection during the previous year. The nationality of such aliens. The average cost per alien of such assistance. The total annual amount paid to each provider or supplier of assistance. The feasibility and estimated cost of expanding the pilot program to items and services provided anywhere in the Southwest border region of the United States. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize any reduction in the funds payable to any person under any Federal program or law other than this subsection , any State or local program or law, any group or individual health plan, or any insurance policy. To the extent provided in appropriations Acts, from amounts made available to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for enforcement and border affairs for each of the 5 fiscal years following the fiscal year in which the Border Hospital Survival and Illegal Immigrant Care Act is enacted, the Attorney General may transfer to the Health Resources and Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services such amounts as may be necessary to carry out this subsection, not to exceed $50,000,000 for each such year.\".","summary":"Border Hospital Survival and Illegal Immigrant Care Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a five-year pilot program of health care provider reimbursement for the costs associated with providing emergency medical and ambulance services in Arizona to: (1) illegal aliens who are not detained by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement authority. Or (2) aliens paroled into the United States for less than one year to receive emergency medical treatment."}

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Persian Gulf War Illness Compensation Act of 2001\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: Although the majority of veterans of the Armed Forces who served in the Persian Gulf War returned from the Southwest Asia theater of operations to normal activities, many of those veterans have experienced a range of unexplained illnesses, including chronic fatigue, muscle and joint pain, loss of concentration, forgetfulness, headache, and rash. Those veterans were potentially exposed during that war to a wide range of biological and chemical agents, including sand, smoke from oil-well fires, paints, solvents, insecticides, petroleum fuels and their combustion products, organophosphate nerve agents, pyridostigmine bromide, depleted uranium, anthrax and botulinum toxoid vaccinations, and infectious diseases, in addition to other psychological and physiological stresses. Section 1117 of title 38, United States Code, enacted on November 2, 1994, by the Persian Gulf War Veterans' Benefits Act , provides for the payment of compensation to Persian Gulf veterans suffering from a chronic disability resulting from an undiagnosed illness that became manifest to a compensable degree within a period prescribed by regulation. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs prescribed regulations under section 1117 of title 38, United States Code, that interpreted that section so as to limit compensation to Persian Gulf veterans with illnesses that \"cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis\". In a report dated September 7, 2000, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences indicated that it was not asked to determine whether an identifiable medical syndrome referred to as \"Gulf War Syndrome\" exists and suggested that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in developing a compensation program for Persian Gulf veterans, consider the health effects that may be associated with exposures to specific agents that were present in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War. <SECTION-HEADER> COMPENSATION OF VETERANS OF PERSIAN GULF WAR WHO HAVE CERTAIN ILLNESSES. Presumptive Period for Undiagnosed Illnesses Program. Section 1117 of title 38, United States Code, is amended in subsection (a)(2), by striking \"within the presumptive period prescribed under subsection (b)\" and inserting \"before December 31, 2011, or such later date as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation\". And by striking subsection (b). Undiagnosed Illnesses. Such section, as amended by subsection , is further amended by inserting after subsection (a) the following new subsection (b): (1) For purposes of this section, the term `undiagnosed illness' means illness manifested by symptoms or signs the cause, etiology, or origin of which cannot be specifically and definitely identified, including poorly defined illnesses such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune disorder, and multiple chemical sensitivity. The attribution of one or more of the symptoms to a disability that is not an undiagnosed illness shall not preclude other symptoms from being considered a manifestation of an undiagnosed illness. For purposes of paragraph (1), signs or symptoms that may be a manifestation of an undiagnosed illness include the following: Fatigue. Unexplained rashes or other dermatological signs or symptoms. Headache. Muscle pain. Joint pain. Neurologic signs or symptoms. Neuropsychological signs or symptoms. Signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system . Sleep disturbances. Gastrointestinal signs or symptoms. Cardiovascular signs or symptoms. Abnormal weight loss. Menstrual disorders.\". Presumption of Service Connection Program.

(1) For purposes of section 5110(g) of title 38, United States Code the amendments to section 1117 of title 38, United States Code, made by subsections (a) and (b) shall take effect as of November 2, 1994. And the amendment to section 1118 of title 38, United States Code, made by subsection (c) shall take effect as of October 21, 1998. The second sentence of section 5110(g) of title 38, United States Code, shall not apply in the case of an award, or increased award, of compensation pursuant to the amendments made by this section if the date of application therefor is not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act.","summary":"Persian Gulf War Illness Compensation Act of 2001 - Amends a veterans' benefits program of compensation for disabilities occurring in veterans of the Persian Gulf War to: (1) require such disabilities, to be compensable, to occur before December 31, 2011, or such later date as prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

This Act may be cited as the \"Improved Health Care at Lower Cost Act of 2013\". <SECTION-HEADER> EXCEPTION AND SAFE HARBOR FROM FEDERAL SANCTIONS FOR INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FROM HOSPITALS TO PHYSICIANS UNDER CERTAIN INCENTIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS. Findings. Congress finds the following: The Department of Health and Human Services has been engaged in approving, on a project-by-project basis, gain- sharing arrangements under demonstration authority for nearly a decade. Based on the knowledge gained from such demonstration projects, the Department is capable of developing and applying standards for permitting such arrangements more generally without the use of such authority. The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services has issued a special advisory bulletin in July 1999 that indicates that there is no general authority for waiving sanctions for any gain-sharing arrangements between physicians and hospitals. Due to lack of capitalization, size limitations, risk characteristics, and other factors, many hospitals and physicians have been unable or unwilling to enter into gain- sharing types of arrangements that meet the requirements of the shared savings program. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish general statutory authority within the Department of Health and Human Services to recognize gain-sharing and other incentive payment programs, other than the shared savings program, that align incentives among hospitals and physicians to improve efficiency and decrease costs while maintaining or improving quality care. Exception From Physician Self-Referral Prohibition.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Making Access Records Available to Lead American Government Openness Act\" or the \"MAR-A-LAGO Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: Beginning in 2009, the Obama administration instituted a policy to release the visitor access records for the White House complex. This policy was responsible for making public the names of nearly 6,000,000 visitors to the White House in the 8 years of the Obama administration. This policy provided the people of the United States with insight into who influences the White House and transparency regarding efforts by lobbyists to effect policies, legislation, and Presidential actions. To date, the Trump administration has not indicated whether it will continue the policy of publicly releasing White House visitor access records. Since taking office on January 20, 2017, President Trump has conducted official business not only in the White House, but also at several of his privately owned clubs and resorts. President Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, has been dubbed the \"Winter White House\" and the \"Southern White House\". President Trump has spent 5 of his first 9 weekends in office at Mar-a-Lago. Mar-a-Lago is a private membership facility open to members, their guests, and others who have been invited as guests for special events. Visitors to Mar-a-Lago do not undergo the same background checks as White House visitors and visitor access records to the club have not been released to the public. The President has conducted official business and hosted international leaders at Mar-a-Lago. Media reports have shown President Trump and members of his Cabinet at Mar-a-Lago and nearby Trump International Golf Club interacting with members and guests, providing access unavailable to the general public. President Trump owns many other properties that offer similar amenities and membership-only access where he is likely to conduct official business during his term in office. On March 11, 2017, President Trump hosted several members of his Cabinet at his Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, to discuss homeland security, health care, and the economy according to media reports. Media reports have indicated that the President may use his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort as a \"Summer White House\". The people of the United States expect and deserve transparency in government. The policy to release visitor access records instituted by the previous administration appropriately balanced transparency with the need for confidentiality in government actions. To the extent Mar-a-Lago and any other private facilities become locations where the President conducts business and interacts with individuals who are not government officials, the same disclosures should apply. <SECTION-HEADER> IMPROVING ACCESS TO INFLUENTIAL VISITOR ACCESS RECORDS. Definitions. In this section: Covered location. The term \"covered location\" means the White House, the residence of the Vice President. And any other location at which the President or the Vice President regularly conducts official business. Covered records.

Exceptions. In general. The President shall not include in the database established under subsection (b) any covered record the posting of which would implicate personal privacy or law enforcement concerns or threaten national security. Or relating to a purely personal guest at a covered location. Sensitive meetings. With respect to a particularly sensitive meeting at a covered location, the President shall include the number of visitors at the covered location in the database established under subsection. And post the applicable covered records in the database established under subsection (b) when the President determines that release of the covered records is no longer sensitive.","summary":"Making Access Records Available to Lead American Government Openness Act or the MAR-A-LAGO Act This bill directs the President to establish and update, every 90 days, a publicly available database that contains records of: the name of each visitor at the White House, residence of the Vice-President, or any other location at which the President or Vice President regularly conducts official business.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Mercury Reduction and Energy Security Act of 2010\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Findings. Congress finds the following: The Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") was required by the terms of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and a 1998 consent agreement to determine whether regulation of mercury from electric utility steam generating units under section 112 of the Clean Air Act was appropriate and necessary. In a December 2000, regulatory finding, the EPA concluded that regulation of mercury from electric utility steam generating units was appropriate and necessary. In 2005, the EPA withdrew its 2000 regulatory finding in favor of a national cap-and-trade system for mercury emissions from electric utility steam generating units, the Clean Air Mercury Rule (\"CAMR\"). CAMR was subsequently challenged in petitions for review filed by 17 States. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the rule on February 8, 2008, finding that once the EPA had listed electric utility steam generating units as a source of hazardous air pollutants, it was required by law to proceed with Maximum Achievable Control Technology (\"MACT\") regulations under section 112 of the Clean Air Act unless it delisted the source category, under procedures set forth in section 112(c)(9). Mercury control technologies for coal-fired electric utility steam generating units have advanced rapidly in the last few years. Purpose. The purpose of this Act is to protect public health and welfare, and the environment, through mercury emission reductions from electric utility steam generating units. <SECTION-HEADER> MERCURY EMISSION REDUCTIONS. The Clean Air Act is amended by adding at the end the following new title: \"TITLE VII MERCURY REDUCTIONS \"Section 701. DEFINITIONS. \"In this title: Affected unit. The term `affected unit' means a coal-fired electric steam generating unit that has a nameplate capacity greater than 25 megawatts. And generates electricity for sale. Cogeneration unit. The term `cogeneration unit' means a stationary, coal-fired boiler or a stationary, coal- fired combustion turbine having equipment used to produce electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of energy that produces during the 12-month period starting on the date the unit first produces electricity and during any calendar year after which the unit first produces electricity for a topping-cycle cogeneration unit useful thermal energy not less than 5 percent of total energy output. And useful power that, when added to one-half of useful thermal energy produced, is not less than 42.5 percent of total energy input if useful thermal energy produced is 15 percent or more of total energy output. Or 45 percent of total energy input if useful thermal energy produced is less than 15 percent of total energy output. And for a bottoming-cycle cogeneration unit, useful power not less than 45 percent of total energy input. Inlet mercury. The term `inlet mercury' means the quantity of mercury found in the as-fired coal used by an affected unit. Or for an affected unit using coal that is subjected to an advanced coal cleaning technology, in the as-mined coal used by the affected unit. \"Section 702. MERCURY REDUCTION PROGRAM. Annual Limitation for Affected Units. Except as provided in subsection (f), an affected unit in operation before or after the date of enactment of this title shall be subject to the following emission limitations on an annual average calendar year basis with respect to mercury: Calendar years 2012 through 2014. For the period beginning on January 1, 2012, and ending on December 31, 2014, the less stringent limitation of the following : 80 percent capture of inlet mercury. An emission rate of 1.60 pounds of mercury per trillion British thermal units of input coal. Calendar year 2015 and thereafter. For calendar year 2015 and each calendar year thereafter, the less stringent limitation of the following : 90 percent capture of inlet mercury. An emission rate of 0.80 pounds of mercury per trillion British thermal units of input coal. Averaging Across Units Within a Facility or State. (1) An owner or operator of more than one affected unit at a single facility may demonstrate compliance with the applicable annual average emission limitations under subsection (a) by averaging emissions from all affected units at that facility, weighted by total input coal British thermal units. An owner or operator of more than one affected unit or units within a State may demonstrate compliance with the applicable annual average emission limitations under subsection (a) by averaging emissions from all affected units owned or operated by that owner or operator within such State, weighted by total input coal British thermal units, if all affected units are owned or operated by the same entity. If an affected unit is owned or operated by more than one entity, the State in which the affected unit is located shall allocate to each such owner or operator an appropriate portion of the generation from the affected unit for purposes of averaging emissions pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2). Reference Methods for Measuring Mercury Emissions. (1) The owner or operator of an affected unit shall use any of the following methods as a reference method to calibrate the instruments used to measure the mercury concentration in emissions from affected units: ASTM D6784-02, `Standard Test Method for Elemental, Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total Mercury in Flue Gas Generated from Coal-Fired Stationary Sources' . 40 C. F. R. Part 60, Appendix A-8, Method 29, `Determination of Metals Emissions from Stationary Sources'. 40 C. F. R. Part 60, Appendix A-8, Method 30A, `Determination of Total Vapor Phase Mercury Emissions from Stationary Sources '. 40 C. F. R. Part 60, Appendix A-8, Method 30B, `Determination of Total Vapor Phase Mercury Emissions from Coal-Fired Combustion Sources Using Carbon Sorbent Traps'. The Administrator may revise or supplement the list of permitted methods set forth in paragraph (1) to reflect improvements or other developments in the measurement of mercury emissions from coal- fired electric steam generating units. Monitoring System. (1) The owner or operator of an affected unit shall install and operate a continuous emissions monitoring system to measure the quantity of mercury that is emitted from each affected unit. For purposes of complying with paragraph (1), the owner or operator of an affected unit may use any CEMS that meets the requirements in Performance Specification 12A (PS-12A), `Specifications and Test Procedures for Total Vapor-Phase Mercury Continuous Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources'. A mercury concentration CEMS that meets the requirements of 40 C. F. R. Part 75. Or a sorbent trap monitoring system that meets the requirements of 40 C. F. R. 75.15 and 40 C. F. R. Part 75, Appendix K, `Quality Assurance and Operating Procedures for Sorbent Trap Monitoring Systems'. The Administrator may revise or supplement the list of permitted monitoring systems set forth in paragraph (2) to reflect improvements or other developments in mercury emissions reduction technologies and mercury emissions monitoring systems. Excess Emissions. (1) Except as provided in subsection (f), the owner or operator of an affected unit that emits mercury in excess of the applicable annual average emission limitation under subsection shall pay an excess emissions penalty determined under paragraph . The excess emissions penalty for mercury shall be an amount equal to $50,000 for each pound of mercury emitted in excess of the applicable annual average emission limitation under subsection (a). Such penalty shall be prorated for each fraction of a pound. Best Practices. (1) Effective, January 1, 2015, if the owner or operator of any affected unit fails to achieve the annual average emission limitation under subsection (a)(2), such owner or operator may notify the Administrator of such failure prior to March 1, 2015, and request an alternate emissions limitation for mercury with respect to such affected unit. Such owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator mercury emissions data measured by a CEMS that complies with subsection (d) for evaluation. If the Administrator determines that such owner or operator has properly installed and operated such CEMS and control technology designed to achieve such annual average emission limitation and is unable to meet such limitation, the Administrator may, not later than April 1, 2016, establish an alternate emissions limitation for mercury with respect to such affected unit based on the optimal performance of properly installed and operated control technology. With respect to any affected unit, for any year for which an alternate emissions limitation for mercury is in place for such affected unit, the Administrator may review such alternate emissions limitation and impose a more stringent emissions limitation for mercury for the subsequent year based on new data regarding the demonstrated control capabilities of the type of control technology installed and operated at such affected unit. (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an owner or operator of an affected unit failing to achieve the annual average emission limitation under subsection (a)(2) that notifies the Administrator of such failure and requests and alternate emissions limitation for mercury pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be considered in compliance with this section for the period beginning on January 1, 2015, and ending on the date such an alternate emissions limitation is implemented. An owner or operator described in subparagraph (A) shall pay an excess emissions penalty, as determined under subsection (e)(2), for the period described in such subparagraph, if such owner or operator operates or maintains the affected unit, including any associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner that is inconsistent with good air pollution control practices for the minimization of mercury emissions, as determined by the Administrator. In determining whether the owner or operator of the affected unit operates and maintains the affected unit in a manner that is consistent with good air pollution control practices for the minimization of mercury emissions, the Administrator may review the emissions monitoring data and operating and maintenance procedures of the affected unit and may inspect the affected unit. (A) With respect to any affected unit for which an alternate emissions limitation for mercury is in place under this subsection, the owner or operator of such affected unit that emits mercury in excess of such alternate emissions limitation shall pay an excess emissions penalty determined under subparagraph (B). The excess emissions penalty for mercury for an owner or operator of an affected unit described in subparagraph (A) shall be an amount equal to $50,000 for each pound of mercury emitted in excess of the alternate emissions limitation for mercury in place for such affected unit. Such penalty shall be prorated for each fraction of a pound. Sole Limitation on Mercury. This title shall apply the sole emission standard or limitation under this Act with regard to the emission of mercury from electric utility steam generating units and shall supersede any other such requirement under section 112 or any other provision of this Act. Relationship to Other Law. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this title, nothing in this title precludes a State or political subdivision of a State from adopting or enforcing any additional requirements for the control or abatement of mercury emissions, except that no State or political subdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard relating to the reduction or control of mercury emissions from electric utility steam generating units that is less stringent than the standards provided in this title.\".","summary":"Mercury Reduction and Energy Security Act of 2010 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require affected units to reduce mercury emissions by the less stringent limitation of: (1) 80 capture of inlet mercury or an emission rate of 1.6 pounds of mercury per trillion British thermal units (Btu) of input coal for the period beginning on January 1, 2012, and ending December 31, 2014.

The Act entitled \"An Act to provide for the organization of the militia of the District of Columbia\", approved March 1, 1889 is amended by adding at the end the following new title: \"TITLE II EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM \"Section 201. SHORT TITLE. FINDINGS. Short Title. This title may be cited as the `Major General David F. Wherley, Jr. District of Columbia National Guard Retention and College Access Act'. Findings. Congress makes the following findings: The District of Columbia National Guard is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the President of the United States as Commander-in-Chief and, unlike other National Guards, is permanently federalized. The District of Columbia National Guard is unique and differs from the National Guards of the several States in that the District of Columbia National Guard is responsible, not only for residents of the District of Columbia, but also for a special and unique mission and obligation as a result of the extensive presence of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia. Consequently, the President of the United States, rather than the chief executive of the District of Columbia, is in command of the District of Columbia National Guard, and only the President can call up the District of Columbia National Guard even for local emergencies. The District of Columbia National Guard has been specifically trained to address the unique emergencies that may occur regarding the presence of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia. The great majority of the members of the District of Columbia National Guard actually live in Maryland or Virginia, rather than in the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia National Guard has been experiencing a disproportionate decline in force in comparison to the National Guards of Maryland and Virginia. The States of Maryland and Virginia provide additional recruiting and retention incentives, such as educational benefits, in order to maintain their force, and their National Guards have drawn recruits from the District of Columbia at a rate that puts at risk the maintenance of the necessary force levels for the District of Columbia National Guard. Funds for an educational benefit for members of the District of Columbia National Guard would provide an incentive to help reverse the loss of members to nearby National Guards and allow for maintenance and increase of necessary District of Columbia National Guard personnel. The loss of members of the District of Columbia National Guard could adversely affect the readiness of the District of Columbia National Guard to respond in the event of a terrorist attack on the capital of the United States. \"Section 202.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Home Health Beneficiary Equity and Payment Simplification Act of 1999\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: Research has shown that medicare beneficiaries who are in need of home health services that are covered under the medicare program generally fall into 1 of the 4 following categories: Post-hospital, short-stay beneficiaries. Medically stable, long-stay beneficiaries. Medically complex, long-stay beneficiaries. Medically unstable and complex, extremely high- use beneficiaries. The interim payment system for home health services under the medicare program, enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and amended by title V of the Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 , is having the following unintended consequences: The sickest, most frail medicare beneficiaries are losing access to medically necessary home health services that are otherwise covered under the medicare program. Many high quality, cost-effective home health agencies have had per beneficiary limits under the interim payment system set so low that such agencies are finding it impossible to continue to provide home health services under the medicare program. Many home health agencies are being subjected to aggregate per beneficiary limits under the interim payment system that do not accurately reflect the current patient mix of such agencies, thereby making it impossible for such agencies to compete with similarly situated home health agencies. Medicare beneficiaries that reside in certain States and regions of the country have far less access to home health services under the medicare program than individuals who have identical medical conditions but reside in other States or regions of the country. The health status of home health beneficiaries varies significantly in different regions of the country, creating differing needs for home health services. <SECTION-HEADER> PAYMENTS TO HOME HEALTH AGENCIES UNDER MEDICARE. Revision of Prospective Payment System. In general. Section 1895 of the Social Security Act (as amended by section 5101 of the Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 is amended in subsection (a), by striking \"for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after October 1, 2000\" and inserting \"for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1999\". And in subsection (b), by striking the last sentence of paragraph (1) and all that follows and inserting the following: Payment basis. In general. The prospective payment amount to be paid to a home health agency under this section for all of the home health services provided to a beneficiary under this title during the 12-month period beginning on the date that such services are first provided by such agency to such beneficiary pursuant to a plan for furnishing such services shall be an amount equal to the applicable amount specified in subparagraph (B) for the fiscal year in which the 12- month period begins. Applicable amount. Subject to subparagraphs , (D), and (E) and paragraph (5), for purposes of this subsection, the applicable amount is equal to $2,603 for a beneficiary described in subparagraphs (A) and (E) of paragraph (3), $3,335 for a beneficiary described in paragraph (3)(B), $4,228 for a beneficiary described in paragraph (3)(C). And $21,864 for a beneficiary described in paragraph (3)(D). Annual update. In general. The applicable amount specified in subparagraph (B) shall be adjusted for each fiscal year in a prospective manner specified by the Secretary by the home health market basket percentage increase applicable to the fiscal year involved. Home health market basket percentage increase. For purposes of clause (i), the term `home health market basket percentage increase' means, with respect to a fiscal year, a percentage determined and applied with respect to the mix of goods and services included in home health services in the same manner as the market basket percentage increase under section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iii) is determined and applied to the mix of goods and services comprising inpatient hospital services for the fiscal year. Area wage adjustment. In general. The portion of the applicable amount specified in subparagraph (B) (as updated under subparagraph (C)) that the Secretary estimates to be attributable to wages and wage-related costs shall be adjusted for geographic differences in such costs by an area wage adjustment factor for the area in which the home health agency is located. Establishment of area wage adjustment factors. The Secretary shall establish area wage adjustment factors that reflect the relative level of wages and wage- related costs applicable to the furnishing of home health services in a geographic area compared to the national average applicable level. Such factors may be the factors used by the Secretary for purposes of section 1886(d)(3)(E). Medical supplies. The applicable amount specified in subparagraph (B) shall be adjusted for each fiscal year in a prospective manner specified by the Secretary by the percentage increase in the average costs of medical supplies (as described in section 1861(m)(5)) for the fiscal year involved.

Title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended by adding at the end the following: \"PART C GEOGRAPHY EDUCATION \"Section 231. FINDINGS. \"Congress makes the following findings: Geographic literacy is essential to a well-prepared citizenry in the 21st Century because geographic factors assume greater importance as the world's economies, societies, and political structures grow more global in scale. In a recent National Geographic-Roper 9-country survey of geographic literacy among young adults aged 18 through 24, Americans ranked second to last. Only 13 percent of young adults aged 18 through 24 in the United States were able to correctly identify Iraq on a map of Asia and the Middle East. The economic stature and competitiveness of the United States requires increasingly sophisticated levels of geographic knowledge and mastery of geographic tools. United States Department of Labor data identifies geotechnology as one of the 3 fastest growing employment fields serving industries such as insurance, banking, real estate, forestry, and agriculture as well as Federal, State, and local Governments. The National Academy of Sciences urged creation of a national program to improve the geographic competence of the United States general population and the school age population. Geography is defined as a `core academic subject' within the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. A recent National Geographic Society survey found that all 50 States and the District of Columbia recognize geography in their curricula or content standards, and an increasing number require geography for graduation and include geography in mandated statewide assessments. Seven of 10 educators responding to a National Geographic survey felt their professional development opportunities in geography were inadequate and half believed their schools had inadequate basic materials for teaching geography. The National Geographic Society has spent over 15 years pioneering an extraordinarily effective national program for improving the teaching of geography by engaging university faculty geographers and highly trained teachers in State Geographic Alliances dedicated to providing high quality professional development opportunities for kindergarten through grade 12 teachers. More than 60 colleges and universities in all 50 States have received grants from the National Geographic Society to support State Geographic Alliances and their professional development programs. Alliance-trained kindergarten through grade 12 teachers and their higher education partners conduct workshops, develop localized teaching materials, and facilitate communication among thousands of teachers whose responsibilities include teaching of geography in various formats and grade levels. A study by Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning that assessed student academic achievement in geography on the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that students taught by Alliance-trained teachers outperformed other students by almost 10 percent. \"Section 232. PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES. Purpose.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Global Service Fellowship Program Act of 2007\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: In confronting terrorism the United States must reach out to other regions of the world to maintain, as well as establish, strong relationships as recommended by the Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States , which stated that \"The United States should rebuild the scholarship, exchange, and library programs that reach out to young people and offer them knowledge and hope. Where such assistance is provided, it should be identified as coming from the citizens of the United States.\". International volunteering opportunities are effective means of addressing critical human needs, building bridges across cultures, and promoting mutual understanding. Current volunteer programs, such as the Peace Corps, remain an important component of Federal efforts to promote volunteer service, cross-cultural understanding, and the values of the United States. The duration of volunteer service opportunities and financial limitations are common barriers to qualified individuals of all backgrounds and ages interested in volunteering overseas, which would be significantly reduced by a global service fellowship program. A global service fellowship program would provide funding and programmatic flexibility for volunteers of all backgrounds and ages. Eligible organizations willing to participate in the fellowship program as sponsoring organizations would be in a better position to recruit volunteers for their programs overseas. <SECTION-HEADER> GLOBAL SERVICE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. Establishment and Purpose. The Secretary of State, in consultation with representatives of the Volunteers for Prosperity program administered by the United States Agency for International Development, shall establish and administer a grant program to be known as the \"Global Service Fellowship Program\" to fund fellowships to promote international volunteering opportunities as a means of addressing critical human needs and promoting mutual understanding by building bridges across cultures, addressing critical human needs, and promoting mutual understanding.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act of 2005\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: The development of uterine fibroids is a common and significant health problem, affecting women, primarily of reproductive age, across all ages, racial backgrounds, and socioeconomic levels. It is estimated that between 20 and 30 percent of women of reproductive age have clinically recognized uterine fibroids, and screening studies indicate the prevalence of uterine fibroids in women may be much higher. Minority women are more likely to develop uterine fibroids, and through ultrasound screening of African American and Caucasian women for fibroids, it is estimated that more than 80 percent of African Americans and about 70 percent of Caucasians develop fibroids by the time they reach menopause and the tumors develop at younger ages in African Americans. Symptomatic uterine fibroids can cause heavy bleeding, pain, and reproductive problems, including infertility. There is no known cause of uterine fibroids. The presence of uterine fibroids is the most common reason for hysterectomies, accounting for approximately one- third of hysterectomies, or 200,000 procedures annually and 22 percent of African American women and 7 percent of Caucasians have hysterectomies for fibroids. Over five billion dollars are spent annually on hysterectomies, at approximately $6,000 for each surgery. The Evidence Report and Summary on the Management of Uterine Fibroids, as compiled by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of the Department of Health and Human Services, held that there is a \"remarkable lack of high quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of most interventions for symptomatic fibroids\". Current research and available data do not provide adequate information on the rates of prevalence and incidents of fibroids in Asian, Hispanic, and other minority women, the costs associated with treating fibroids, and the methods by which fibroids may be prevented in these women. <SECTION-HEADER> RESEARCH WITH RESPECT TO UTERINE FIBROIDS.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Electronic Commerce Enhancement Act of 2001\". TITLE I ELECTRONIC COMMERCE Section 101. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: Commercial transactions on the Internet, whether retail business-to-customer or business-to-business, are commonly called electronic commerce. In the United States, business-to-business transactions between small and medium-sized manufacturers and other such businesses and their suppliers is rapidly growing, as many of these businesses begin to use Internet connections for supply- chain management, after-sales support, and payments. Small and medium-sized manufacturers and other such businesses play a critical role in the United States economy. Electronic commerce can help small and medium-sized manufacturers and other such businesses develop new products and markets, interact more quickly and efficiently with suppliers and customers, and improve productivity by increasing efficiency and reducing transaction costs and paperwork. Small and medium-sized manufacturers and other such businesses who fully exploit the potential of electronic commerce activities can use it to interact with customers, suppliers, and the public, and for external support functions such as personnel services and employee training. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Manufacturing Extension Partnership program has a successful record of assisting small and medium-sized manufacturers and other such businesses. In addition, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, working with the Small Business Administration, successfully assisted United States small enterprises in remediating their Y2K computer problems. A critical element of electronic commerce is the ability of different electronic commerce systems to exchange information. The continued growth of electronic commerce will be enhanced by the development of private voluntary interoperability standards and testbeds to ensure the compatibility of different systems. Section 102. REPORT ON THE UTILIZATION OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE. Advisory Panel. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology shall establish an Advisory Panel to report on the challenges facing small and medium-sized manufacturers and other such businesses in integrating and utilizing electronic commerce technologies and business practices.

The Congress finds that cigarette smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco products continue to represent major health hazards to the Nation, causing approximately 434,000 deaths each year.

Each day, more than 3,000 children and adolescents start smoking and collectively consume nearly one billion packs of cigarettes per year. Reliable studies indicate that tobacco is a gateway to other, increasingly more harmful drugs, and that tobacco use continues after use of other drugs begins. And the Congress of the United States has a major policy setting role in ensuring that the use of tobacco products among minors is discouraged to the maximum extent possible. <SECTION-HEADER> DEFINITIONS.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This act may be referred to as the \"Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds that in most areas of governmental concern, State governments possess both the Constitutional authority and the competence to discern the needs and the desires of the People and to govern accordingly. Federal laws and agency regulations, which have interfered with State powers in areas of State jurisdiction, should be restricted to powers delegated to the Federal Government by the Constitution. The framers of the Constitution intended to bestow upon the Federal Government only limited authority over the States and the People. Under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. And the courts, which have in general construed the Tenth Amendment not to restrain the Federal Government's power to act in areas of state jurisdiction, should be directed to strictly construe Federal laws and regulations which interfere with State powers with a presumption in favor of State authority and against Federal preemption. <SECTION-HEADER> CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION. On or after January 1, 1997, any statute enacted by Congress shall include a declaration that authority to govern in the area addressed by the statute is delegated to Congress by the Constitution, including a citation to the specific Constitutional authority relied upon. That Congress specifically finds that it has a greater degree of competence than the States to govern in the area addressed by the statute. And if the statute interferes with State powers or preempts any State or local government law, regulation or ordinance, that Congress specifically intends to interfere with State powers or preempt State or local government law, regulation, or ordinance, and that such preemption is necessary. Congress must make specific factual findings in support of the declarations described in this section. <SECTION-HEADER> POINT OF ORDER. In General. Information required. It shall not be in order in either the Senate or House of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution, or amendment that does not include a declaration of Congressional intent as required under section 3. Supermajority required. The requirements of this subsection may be waived or suspended in the Senate or House of Representatives only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of that House duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate or House of Representatives duly chosen and sworn shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair on a point of order raised under this subsection. Rule Making. This section is enacted as an exercise of the rule-making power of the Senate and House of Representatives, and as such, it is deemed a part of the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives, but is applicable only with respect to the matters described in sections 3 and 4 and supersedes other rules of the Senate or House of Representatives only to the extent that such sections are inconsistent with such rules. And with full recognition of the Constitutional right of the Senate or House of Representatives to change such rules at any time, in the same manner as in the case of any rule of the Senate or House of Representatives. <SECTION-HEADER> EXECUTIVE PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW. In General. Chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by inserting after section 559 the following new section: \"Section 560. PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW. No executive department or agency or independent agency shall construe any statutory authorization to issue regulations as authorizing preemption of State law or local ordinance by rule-making or other agency action unless the statute expressly authorizes issuance of preemptive regulations. And the executive department, agency or independent agency concludes that the exercise of State power directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal power under the Federal statute, such that the State statutes and the Federal rule promulgated under the Federal statute cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together. Any regulatory preemption of State law shall be narrowly tailored to achieve the objectives of the statute pursuant to which the regulations are promulgated and shall explicitly describe the scope of preemption. When an executive branch department or agency or independent agency proposes to act through rule-making or other agency action to preempt State law, the department or agency shall provide all affected States notice and an opportunity for comment by duly elected or appointed State and local government officials or their designated representatives in the proceedings. The notice of proposed rule-making must be forwarded to the Governor, the Attorney General and the presiding officer of each chamber of the Legislature of each State setting forth the extent and purpose of the preemption. In the table of contents of each Federal Register, there shall be a separate list of preemptive regulations contained within that Register. Unless a final executive department or agency or independent agency rule or regulation contains an explicit provision declaring the Federal Government's intent to preempt State or local government powers and an explicit description of the extent and purpose of that preemption, the rule or regulation shall not be construed to preempt any State or local government law, ordinance or regulation. Each executive department or agency or independent agency shall publish in the Federal Register a plan for periodic review of the rules and regulations issued by the department or agency that preempt, in whole or in part, State or local government powers. This plan may be amended by the department or agency at any time by publishing a revision in the Federal Register. The purpose of this review shall be to determine whether and to what extent such rules are to continue without change, consistent with the stated objectives of the applicable statutes, or are to be altered or repealed to minimize the effect of the rules on State or local government powers.\". Any Federal rule or regulation promulgated after January 1, 1997, that is promulgated in a manner inconsistent with this section shall not be binding on any State or local government, and shall not preempt any State or local government law, ordinance, or regulation. Conforming Amendment. The table of sections for chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding after the item for section 559 the following: \"560. Preemption of State Law.\". <SECTION-HEADER> CONSTRUCTION. No statute, or rule promulgated under such statute, enacted after the date of enactment of this Act, shall be construed by courts or other adjudicative entities to preempt, in whole or in part, any State or local government law, ordinance or regulation unless the statute, or rule promulgated under such statute, contains an explicit declaration of intent to preempt, or unless there is a direct conflict between such statute and a State or local government law, ordinance, or regulation, such that the two cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, any ambiguities in this Act, or in any other law of the United States, shall be construed in favor of preserving the authority of the States and the People. If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the Act and the application of such provision to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.","summary":"Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996 - Requires that, on or after January 1, 1997, any statute enacted by the Congress must include specified findings and declarations about the Constitutional authority of the Congress in enacting such statute to preempt State and local laws. Makes it out of order for the Senate or House of Representatives to consider any legislation that does not include such declarations, unless a supermajority in either House vote otherwise. Amends Federal law to prohibit any executive department or agency from construing any statutory authorization to issue regulations as authorizing preemption of State law or local ordinance by rule-making or other agency action, unless the statute expressly authorizes issuance of preemptive regulations and the agency concludes that the exercise of State power directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal power under the Federal statute, such that the State statutes and the Federal rule promulgated under the Federal statute cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together. Provides for notice and opportunity for State comment when a Federal agency proposes preemptive rule making or other agency action. Requires each Federal agency to publish in the Federal Register a plan for periodic review of rules and regulations preempting State or local government powers."}

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Program Assessment and Results Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds that inefficiency and ineffectiveness in Federal programs undermines the confidence of the American people in the Government and reduces the Federal Government's ability to adequately address vital public needs. Insufficient information on program performance seriously disadvantages Federal managers in their efforts to improve program efficiency and effectiveness. Congressional policy making, spending decisions, and program oversight are handicapped by insufficient attention to program performance and results. Programs performing similar or duplicative functions that exist within a single agency or across multiple agencies should be identified and their performance and results shared among all such programs to improve their performance and results. Advocates of good government continue to seek ways to improve accountability, focus on results, and integrate the performance of programs with decisions about budgets. With the passage of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Congress directed the executive branch to seek improvements in the effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability of Federal programs by having agencies focus on program results. And the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 provided a strong framework for the executive branch to monitor the long-term goals and annual performance of its departments and agencies. <SECTION-HEADER> PURPOSE. The purposes of this Act are to improve the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 by implementing a program assessment and evaluation process that attempts to determine the strengths and weaknesses of Federal programs with a particular focus on the results produced by individual programs. To use the information gathered in the assessment and evaluation process to build on the groundwork laid in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 to help the executive branch make informed management decisions and evidence-based funding requests aimed at achieving positive results. And to provide congressional policy makers the information needed to conduct more effective oversight, to make better- informed authorization decisions, and to make more evidence- based spending decisions that achieve positive results for the American people. <SECTION-HEADER> PROGRAM ASSESSMENT.

And the trust funds for such program contain claims on future Government resources sufficient to cover the deficit through 2037, but after that date, the trust funds would collect sufficient revenues to pay 72 percent of benefits. And a statement explaining the nature of the Federal old age, survivors, and disability insurance trust funds, including the following: `Social Security Trust Fund balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other Trust Fund responsibilities only in a bookkeeping sense. They do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, such balances are claims on the United States Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large Social Security Trust Fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the Federal Government's ability to pay benefits.'.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: Congress supports the goals of Indian self- determination and economic development. Congress supports the efforts of Indian tribes to promote their economic development efforts, wherever possible, in cooperation with State and local governments and others. The Puyallup tribe, a signatory to the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek, has a reservation in Washington State. The Puyallup tribe, which operates gaming facilities pursuant to a compact with the State of Washington, is a significant source of jobs in the area of Tacoma, Washington. The Port of Tacoma is an independent, municipal corporation that operates under State enabling legislation. The Port of Tacoma is also a significant source of jobs in the area of Tacoma, Washington. The Port of Tacoma is in the process of expanding its operations to provide greater economic opportunities for the City of Tacoma, Pierce County, and the State of Washington. The Port of Tacoma's expansion requires the closure of the primary access road for one of the Puyallup tribe's gaming operations. Without this access road, the Puyallup tribe's gaming facility will no longer be economically viable at its current location. To avoid economic dislocation, including for the employees of the current facility, the Puyallup tribe has identified land on the Puyallup Reservation that would provide a suitable substitute location for its gaming facility. The Puyallup tribe, as a result of the Port of Tacoma's road closure, seeks to have certain land taken into trust within its reservation. The Puyallup tribe has worked closely and cooperatively with all affected entities, and the State of Washington, Pierce County, the City of Tacoma, the City of Fife, and the Port of Tacoma all support the Puyallup tribe in connection with this trust land acquisition. <SECTION-HEADER> TRUST LAND ACQUISITION.

Girls born to teenage mothers are more likely to become teenager mothers themselves. Boys born to teenage mothers are more likely to end up in prison. Innovative initiatives, such as increasing parental involvement and portraying the consequences of teenage pregnancy through the media, exist that can reduce the rates of teenage pregnancy and give every young person a better hope for the future.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"American Land Sovereignty Protection Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Findings. Congress finds the following: The power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations governing lands belonging to the United States is vested in the Congress under article IV, section 3, of the Constitution. Some Federal land designations made pursuant to international agreements concern land use policies and regulations for lands belonging to the United States which under article IV, section 3, of the Constitution can only be implemented through laws enacted by the Congress. Some international land designations, such as those under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and the Man and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific, Educational, and Cultural Organization, operate under independent national committees, such as the United States National Man and Biosphere Committee, which have no legislative directives or authorization from the Congress. Actions by the United States in making such designations may affect the use and value of nearby or intermixed non-Federal lands. The sovereignty of the States is a critical component of our Federal system of government and a bulwark against the unwise concentration of power. Private property rights are essential for the protection of freedom. Actions by the United States to designate lands belonging to the United States pursuant to international agreements in some cases conflict with congressional constitutional responsibilities and State sovereign capabilities. Actions by the President in applying certain international agreements to lands owned by the United States diminishes the authority of the Congress to make rules and regulations respecting these lands. Purpose. The purposes of this Act are the following: To reaffirm the power of the Congress under article IV, section 3, of the Constitution over international agreements which concern disposal, management, and use of lands belonging to the United States. To protect State powers not reserved to the Federal Government under the Constitution from Federal actions designating lands pursuant to international agreements. To ensure that no United States citizen suffers any diminishment or loss of individual rights as a result of Federal actions designating lands pursuant to international agreements for purposes of imposing restrictions on use of those lands. To protect private interests in real property from diminishment as a result of Federal actions designating lands pursuant to international agreements. To provide a process under which the United States may, when desirable, designate lands pursuant to international agreements. <SECTION-HEADER> CLARIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL ROLE IN WORLD HERITAGE SITE LISTING. Section 401 of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 is amended in subsection (a) in the first sentence, by striking \"The Secretary\" and inserting \"Subject to subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e), the Secretary\", and inserting \"\" after \"1973\". And by adding at the end the following new subsections: (1) The Secretary of the Interior may not nominate any lands owned by the United States for inclusion on the World Heritage List pursuant to the Convention, unless the Secretary finds with reasonable basis that commercially viable uses of the nominated lands, and commercially viable uses of other lands located within 10 miles of the nominated lands, in existence on the date of the nomination will not be adversely affected by inclusion of the lands on the World Heritage List, and publishes that finding. The Secretary has submitted to the Congress a report describing natural resources associated with the lands referred to in subparagraph (A).

Congress makes the following findings: Legitimate Internet sellers of prescription drugs can offer substantial benefits to consumers. These potential benefits include convenience, privacy, valuable information, competitive prices, and personalized services. Unlawful Internet sellers of prescription drugs may dispense inappropriate, contaminated, counterfeit, or subpotent prescription drugs that could put at risk the health and safety of consumers. Unlawful Internet sellers have exposed consumers to significant health risks by knowingly filling invalid prescriptions, such as prescriptions based solely on an online questionnaire, or by dispensing prescription drugs without any prescription. The ease with which web sites can be created and removed and the lack of readily available information to identify Internet sellers creates significant barriers to effective law enforcement efforts against unlawful Internet sellers. Consumers may have difficulty distinguishing legitimate from unlawful Internet sellers, as well as foreign from domestic Internet sellers, of prescription drugs. States need additional enforcement tools to take effective action against unlawful domestic Internet sellers and the Federal agencies need additional enforcement tools to take effective action against unlawful foreign Internet sellers. Purpose. The purpose of this Act is to provide Federal and State law enforcement with adequate tools to take effective action against interstate Internet sellers of prescription drugs who illegally sell such drugs to consumers in the United States and to protect such consumers against potential harms that may result from purchasing such drugs from such sellers. <SECTION-HEADER> AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the \"FHA Manufactured Housing Loan Modernization Act of 2007\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. Findings. The Congress finds that manufactured housing plays a vital role in providing housing for low- and moderate-income families in the United States. The FHA title I insurance program for manufactured home loans traditionally has been a major provider of mortgage insurance for home-only transactions. The manufactured housing market is in the midst of a prolonged downturn which has resulted in a severe contraction of traditional sources of private lending for manufactured home purchases. During past downturns the FHA title I insurance program for manufactured homes has filled the lending void by providing stability until the private markets could recover. In 1992, during the manufactured housing industry's last major recession, over 30,000 manufactured home loans were insured under title I. In 2006, fewer than 1,500 manufactured housing loans were insured under title I. The loan limits for title I manufactured housing loans have not been adjusted for inflation since 1992. And these problems with the title I program have resulted in an atrophied market for manufactured housing loans, leaving American families who have the most difficulty achieving homeownership without adequate financing options for home-only manufactured home purchases. Purposes. The purposes of this Act are to provide adequate funding for FHA-insured manufactured housing loans for low- and moderate-income homebuyers during all economic cycles in the manufactured housing industry. To modernize the FHA title I insurance program for manufactured housing loans to enhance participation by Ginnie Mae and the private lending markets. And to adjust the low loan limits for title I manufactured home loan insurance to reflect the increase in costs since such limits were last increased in 1992 and to index the limits to inflation. <SECTION-HEADER> EXCEPTION TO LIMITATION ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PORTFOLIO.

{"source":"SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Securities Private Enforcement Reform Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds that excessive securities litigation is a serious burden on the national economy, diverting limited capital resources to less productive areas. Meritless lawsuits filed under Federal securities laws are making it harder for American companies to raise capital and attract experienced members to serve on their boards. In the past 3 years, issuers of 1 out of every 12 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange have been sued for securities fraud. In the securities fraud area, the civil justice system is being transformed into a nonmerit-based, unjust system, in which professional plaintiffs extract settlements from entrepreneurs, regardless of the merits of the cases filed. Such securities lawsuits impose additional costs on publicly traded companies, often force them into bankruptcy, and create job losses within the economy. Such securities fraud lawsuits stifle the development of future products by compelling investment bankers and accounting firms, whose assistance is essential for accessing capital markets, to resist working with new venture firms because of the higher risk of litigation associated with them. And reform in the securities fraud laws are needed to ensure that the courts can properly hear and adjudicate securities fraud cases. <SECTION-HEADER> PRIVATE CIVIL ACTION PROCEDURES. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended by inserting after section 20A the following new section: \"private civil action procedures \"Section 20B. (a) Requirement of Proportionate Liability. Limitation on joint and several liability. A defendant who is found liable for damages in an implied private action arising under a provision of this Act may be liable jointly and severally only if the trier of fact specifically determines that the defendant engaged in knowing securities fraud, as defined in paragraph (3). Determination of liability. If the trier of fact does not find, pursuant to paragraph (1), that the defendant engaged in knowing securities fraud, the defendant's liability shall be determined as follows: The trier of fact shall determine the percentage of responsibility of the plaintiff, of each of the defendants and of each of the other persons or entities alleged by the parties to have caused or contributed to the harm alleged by the plaintiff. In determining the percentages of responsibility, the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each person and the nature and extent of the causal relationship between that conduct and the damage claimed by the plaintiff. For each defendant, the trier of fact shall then multiply the defendant's percentage of responsibility by the total amount of damage suffered by the plaintiff that was caused in whole or in part by that defendant and shall enter a verdict or judgment against the defendant in that amount. No defendant whose liability is determined under this subsection shall be jointly liable on any judgment entered against any other party to the action. Except where contractual relationship permits, no defendant whose liability is determined under this subsection shall have a right to recover from another defendant any portion of the judgment entered against him. Definition. A defendant engages in `knowing securities fraud' only if he (A) makes a material representation with actual knowledge that the representation is false or omits to make a statement with actual knowledge that, as a result of the omission, one of his material representations is false. And (B) knows that other persons are likely to rely on that misrepresentation or omission. Reckless conduct by the defendant shall not constitute `knowing securities fraud'. The liability in damages, in any, of a defendant who acts in a reckless manner shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (3). Coverage of provision. This subsection relates only to the allocation of damages among defendants. Nothing herein shall affect the standards for liability under any implied private action arising under a provision of this Act. Awards of Attorney Fees. Authority to award fees. If the court in any implied private action arising under this Act enters a final judgment against a party litigant on the basis of a motion to dismiss, motion for summary judgment, or a trial on the merits, the court shall, upon motion by the prevailing party, award the prevailing party reasonable fees and other expenses incurred by that party unless the court determines that the position of the losing party was substantially justified. If the court determines that the position of the losing party was substantially justified, it shall not award fees and other expenses to the prevailing party. The determination whether the position of the losing party was substantially justified shall be made on the basis of the record which is made in the civil action for which fees and other expenses are sought. Application for fees. A party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall, within 30 days of a final, nonappealable judgment in the action, submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses that verifies that the party is entitled to such an award under paragraph (1) and the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness representing or appearing on behalf of the party stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses are computed. Allocation and size of award. The court, in its discretion, may determine whether the amount to be awarded pursuant to this section shall be awarded against the unsuccessful party, its attorney, or both. And reduce the amount to be awarded pursuant to this section, or deny an award, to the extent that the prevailing party during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct that unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy. Awards in discovery proceedings. In adjudicating any motion for an order compelling discovery or any motion for a protective order made in any implied private action arising under this Act, the court shall award the prevailing party reasonable fees and other expenses incurred by the party in bringing or defending against the motion, including reasonable attorney fees, unless the court finds that special circumstances make an award unjust. Definitions. For purposes of this subsection The term `fees and other expenses' includes the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, report, test, or project which is found by the court to be necessary for the preparation of the party's case, and reasonable attorney fees and expenses. The amount of fees awarded under this section shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of services furnished. The term `substantially justified' shall have the same meaning as in section 2412(d)(1) of title 28, United States Code. Abusive Practices. Shares of awards to representative plaintiffs. In any implied private action arising under this Act that is certified as a plaintiff class action pursuant to the Federal rules of civil procedures, the share of any final judgment or of any settlement that is awarded to any party serving as a representative plaintiff shall be calculated in the same manner as the shares of the final judgment or settlement awarded to all other members of the plaintiff class. Representation of class actions. (A) In any implied private action arising under this Act that is certified as a plaintiff class action pursuant to the Federal rules of civil procedure, the plaintiff class may not be represented by (i) any attorney who directly or indirectly owned or otherwise had a beneficial interest in the securities that are the subject of the litigation, or (ii) any attorney affiliated with such an attorney. An attorney who knowingly violates this prohibition shall be barred from representing any party in any action arising under this Act or under the Securities Act of 1933. In any implied private action arising under this Act that is certified as a plaintiff class action, an attorney may not represent the plaintiff class if the attorney has paid or is obligated to pay a fee to a third party who assisted him in obtaining the representation of any party to the action. An attorney who knowingly violates this prohibition shall be barred from representing any party in any action arising under this Act or under the Securities Act of 1933. Disgorged funds. (A) Funds disgorged as a result of any action brought by the Commission in Federal court or of any Commission administrative action shall not be distributed as payment for attorney fees or expenses incurred by private parties seeking distribution of the disgorged funds. Any judgment awarded against any person in any implied private action arising under this Act shall be diminished by the amounts, if any, that such person has been or may be required to disgorge, pursuant to a court order obtained at the instance of the Commission in a proceeding brought under section 21(d) of this Act, or in connection with any Commission administrative action, relating to the same alleged misconduct. Burden of Proof. In any implied cause of action arising under this Act in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only if it proves that the defendant acted with scienter, the plaintiff must establish that element of his claim by clear and convincing evidence in order to establish a right to recover money damages. Pleading Requirement. In any implied cause of action arising under this Act in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only if it proves that the defendant acted with scienter, the plaintiff must allege in its complaint facts suggesting that the defendant acted with that state of mind. Aiding and Abetting Liability. In any implied cause of action arising under this Act in which the plaintiff may recover damages only if it proves that the defendant acted with scienter, a defendant may be held liable as an aider and abettor only if the plaintiff proves that the defendant knew that another party had violated a provision of this Act and that the defendant, acting with deliberate intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud for the defendant's own direct pecuniary benefit, provided substantial assistance to the other party's violation. Direct pecuniary benefit shall not include ordinary compensation for services provided.\". <SECTION-HEADER> TIME LIMITATION ON PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended by adding at the end the following new section: \"Section 36. LIMITATION ON PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION. \"Except as otherwise provided in this Act, any private right of action arising from a violation of this Act shall be brought not later than the earlier of 5 years after the date on which such violation occurred. Or one year after the date on which the violation was discovered or should have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence.\". <SECTION-HEADER> EFFECTIVE DATE. The provisions of this Act shall apply to all actions commenced on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.","summary":"Securities Private Enforcement Reform Act - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to declare that a defendant may be liable jointly and severally for damages in an implied private action only if the trier of fact specifically determines that the defendant knowingly engaged in securities fraud.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"State Court Interpreter Grant Program Act of 2012\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds that the fair administration of justice depends on the ability of all participants in a courtroom proceeding to understand that proceeding, regardless of their English proficiency. 21 percent of the population of the United States over 5 years of age speaks a language other than English at home. Only qualified and certified court interpreters can ensure that persons with limited English proficiency comprehend judicial proceedings in which they are a party. The knowledge and skills required of a qualified court interpreter differ substantially from those required in other interpretation settings, such as social service, medical, diplomatic, and conference settings. The Federal Government has demonstrated its commitment to equal administration of justice, regardless of English proficiency. Regulations implementing title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , as well as the guidance issued by the Department of Justice pursuant to Executive Order 13166, issued August 11, 2000, clarify that all recipients of Federal financial assistance, including State courts, are required to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their proceedings for persons with limited English proficiency. 43 States have developed, or are developing, qualified court interpreter programs. A robust and effective court interpreter program actively recruits skilled individuals to serve as court interpreters, trains those individuals in the interpretation of court proceedings. Develops and uses a thorough, systematic certification process for court interpreters. Has sufficient funding to ensure that a qualified and certified interpreter will be available to the court whenever necessary, and efficiently uses funding to create substantial cost savings. And Federal funding is necessary to encourage State courts that do not have court interpreter programs to develop them. Assist State courts with nascent court interpreter programs to implement them. Assist State courts with limited court interpreter programs to enhance them.

This Act may be cited as the \"California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area Designation and Management Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Findings. Congress makes the following findings: The California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area established by this Act contains a series of ancient volcanos and underwater geological features in the Exclusive Economic Zone. Found on the seamounts, ridges, and banks in the Conservation Area are rare deep-water corals, sponges, anemones, tunas, sharks, seabirds, marine mammals , endangered sea turtles, octopuses, and diverse fish populations, some of which are endemic to the area. The only hydrothermal vents in the continental Exclusive Economic Zone are found on Gorda Ridge located off the north coast of California and the south coast of Oregon. These areas' remote location and depth contribute to their remarkably pristine condition, limited human footprint, and reputation as a vital frontier for scientific discovery, with research expeditions continuing to yield new and rare species, greater understanding about ecological relationships, and renewed appreciation of the uniqueness of deep-sea ecosystems. Despite currently limited direct pressure from extractive use, the Conservation Area is undergoing rapid change due to warming waters, ocean acidification, and ecological stress from pollution and other sources the management of which transcends the jurisdiction of any single government agency or department. According to many scientists, comprehensive marine habitat protection is one of the most important actions for building resilience in ocean environments to current and emerging challenges presented by anthropogenic and other stressors impacting marine ecosystems.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2007\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds that the defects in the United States civil justice system have a direct and undesirable effect on interstate commerce by decreasing the availability of goods and services in commerce. The spiraling costs of litigation and the magnitude and unpredictability of punitive damage awards and noneconomic damage awards have continued unabated for at least the past 30 years. The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence of unlawful conduct. Just as punitive damage awards can be grossly excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some circumstances for a party to be held responsible under the doctrine of joint and several liability for damages that party did not cause. As a result of joint and several liability, entities including small businesses are often brought into litigation despite the fact that their conduct may have little or nothing to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to the lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust costs due to the possibility or result of unfair and disproportionate damage awards. Due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their activities. And legislation to address these concerns is an appropriate exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses 3, 9, and 18 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States, and the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States. <SECTION-HEADER> DEFINITIONS. In this Act: Crime of violence. The term \"crime of violence\" has the same meaning as in section 16 of title 18, United States Code. Drug. The term \"drug\" means any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act that was not legally prescribed for use by the defendant or that was taken by the defendant other than in accordance with the terms of a lawfully issued prescription. Economic loss. The term \"economic loss\" means any pecuniary loss resulting from harm to the extent recovery for such loss is allowed under applicable State law. Harm. The term \"harm\" means any physical injury, illness, disease, or death or damage to property. International terrorism. The term \"international terrorism\" has the same meaning as in section 2331 of title 18, United States Code. Noneconomic loss. The term \"noneconomic loss\" means loss for physical or emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and companionship, loss of consortium , injury to reputation, or any other nonpecuniary loss of any kind or nature.

Congress makes the following findings: An estimated 2,000,000 dogs and cats are slaughtered and sold annually as part of the international fur trade. Internationally, dog and cat fur is used in a wide variety of products, including fur coats and jackets, fur-trimmed garments, hats, gloves, decorative accessories, stuffed animals, and other toys. As demonstrated by forensic tests, dog and cat fur products are being imported into the United States, in some cases with deceptive labeling to conceal the use of dog or cat fur. Dog and cat fur, when dyed, is not easily distinguishable to persons who are not experts from other furs such as fox, rabbit, coyote, wolf, and mink. Dog and cat fur is generally less expensive than other types of fur and may be used as a substitute for more expensive types of furs. Foreign fur producers use dogs and cats bred for their fur, and also use strays and stolen pets. The methods of housing, transporting, and slaughtering dogs and cats for fur production are generally unregulated and inhumane. Purposes. The purposes of this Act are to prohibit the sale, manufacture, offer for sale, transportation, and distribution in the United States of dog and cat fur products. To require accurate labeling of fur species so that consumers in the United States can make informed choices. And to prohibit the trade in, both imports and exports of, dog and cat fur products, to ensure that the United States market does not encourage the slaughter of dogs or cats for their fur, and to ensure that the purposes of this Act are not undermined. <SECTION-HEADER> DEFINITIONS.

A February 2011 plot by Khaled Aldawsari, a Saudi-born student, to manufacture explosives and potentially attack New York, New York, the Dallas, Texas, home of former President George W. Bush, as well as hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, and a nightclub. Since the September 11, 2001, attacks on our Nation, the United States and allied forces have captured thousands of individuals fighting for or supporting al Qaeda and associated terrorist organizations that do not abide by the law of war, including detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who served as planners of those attacks, trainers of terrorists, financiers of terrorists, bomb makers, bodyguards for Osama bin Laden, recruiters of terrorists, and facilitators of terrorism. Many of the detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay provided valuable intelligence that gave the United States insight into al Qaeda and its methods, prevented terrorist attacks, and saved lives. Intelligence obtained from detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay was critical to eventually identifying the location of Osama bin Laden. In a February 17, 2011, hearing of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, the Secretary of Defense confirmed that approximately 25 percent of detainees released from the detention facility at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay are confirmed to have reengaged in hostilities or are suspected of having reengaged in hostilities against the United States or our allies. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an organization that includes former detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay among its leadership and ranks, has claimed responsibility for several of the recent plots and attacks against the United States. Detention according to the law of war is a matter of national security and military necessity and has long been recognized as legitimate under international law. Detaining unprivileged enemy belligerents prevents them from returning to the battlefield to attack United States and allied military personnel and engaging in future terrorist attacks against innocent civilians. The Joint Task Force-Guantanamo provides for the humane, legal, and transparent care and custody of detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, notwithstanding regular assaults on the guard force by some detainees. The International Committee of the Red Cross visits detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay on a quarterly basis. The detention facility at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay benefits from robust oversight by Congress. <SECTION-HEADER> REAFFIRMATION OF AUTHORITY TO MAINTAIN UNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, AS A LOCATION FOR THE DETENTION OF UNPRIVILEGED ENEMY BELLIGERENTS HELD BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: Hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, and thunderstorms can cause significant loss of life, injury, destruction of property, and economic and social disruption. All States and regions are vulnerable to these hazards. The United States currently sustains several billion dollars in economic damages each year due to these windstorms. In recent decades, rapid development and population growth in high-risk areas has greatly increased overall vulnerability to windstorms. Improved windstorm impact reduction measures have the potential to reduce these losses through cost-effective and affordable design and construction methods and practices, effective mitigation programs at the local, State, and national level, improved data collection and analysis and impact prediction methodologies. Engineering research on improving new structures and retrofitting existing ones to better withstand windstorms, atmospheric-related research to better understand the behavior and impact of windstorms on the built environment, and subsequent application of those research results. And public education and outreach. There is an appropriate role for the Federal Government in supporting windstorm impact reduction. An effective Federal program in windstorm impact reduction will require interagency coordination, and input from individuals, academia, the private sector, and other interested non-Federal entities. <SECTION-HEADER> DEFINITIONS. In this Act: The term \"Director\" means the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The term \"State\" means each of the States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United States. The term \"windstorm\" means any storm with a damaging or destructive wind component, such as a hurricane, tropical storm, tornado, or thunderstorm. <SECTION-HEADER> NATIONAL WINDSTORM IMPACT REDUCTION PROGRAM. Establishment. There is established the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program . Objective. The objective of the Program is the achievement of major measurable reductions in losses of life and property from windstorms. The objective is to be achieved through a coordinated Federal effort, in cooperation with other levels of government, academia, and the private sector, aimed at improving the understanding of windstorms and their impacts and developing and encouraging implementation of cost-effective mitigation measures to reduce those impacts. Interagency Working Group. Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director shall establish an Interagency Working Group consisting of representatives of the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and other Federal agencies as appropriate. The Director shall designate an agency to serve as Chair of the Working Group and be responsible for the planning, management, and coordination of the Program, including budget coordination. Specific agency roles and responsibilities under the Program shall be defined in the implementation plan required under subsection (e). General agency responsibilities shall include the following: The National Institute of Standards and Technology shall support research and development to improve building codes and standards and practices for design and construction of buildings, structures, and lifelines. The National Science Foundation shall support research in engineering and the atmospheric sciences to improve the understanding of the behavior of windstorms and their impact on buildings, structures, and lifelines.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency shall support the development of risk assessment tools and effective mitigation techniques, windstorm-related data collection and analysis, public outreach, information dissemination, and implementation of mitigation measures consistent with the Agency's all-hazards approach. Program Components. In general. The Program shall consist of three primary mitigation components: improved understanding of windstorms, windstorm impact assessment, and windstorm impact reduction. The components shall be implemented through activities such as data collection and analysis, risk assessment, outreach, technology transfer, and research and development. To the extent practicable, research activities authorized under this Act shall be peer-reviewed, and the components shall be designed to be complementary to, and avoid duplication of, other public and private hazard reduction efforts.

The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall determine the total number of fuels approved under this paragraph as of September 1, 2004, in all State implementation plans and shall publish a list of such fuels, including the states and Petroleum Administration for Defense District in which they are used, in the Federal Register no later than 90 days after enactment. The Administrator shall remove a fuel from the list published under subclause (II) if a fuel ceases to be included in a State implementation plan or if a fuel in a State implementation plan is identical to a Federal fuel formulation implemented by the Administrator and shall reduce the total number of fuels authorized under the list published under subclause (II) appropriately. Subclause (I) shall not limit the Administrator's authority to approve a control or prohibition respecting any new fuel under this paragraph in a State's implementation plan or a revision to that State's implementation plan after the date of enactment of this Act if such new fuel completely replaces a fuel on the list published under subclause (II). The Administrator shall have no authority under this paragraph, when considering any particular State's implementation plan or a revision to that State's implementation plan, to approve any fuel unless that fuel was, as of the date of such consideration, approved in at least one State implementation plan in the applicable Petroleum Administrator for Defense District. However, the Administrator may approve as part of a State implementation plan or State implementation plan revision a fuel with a summertime Reid Vapor Pressure of 7.0 psi. In no event shall such approval by the Administrator cause an increase in the total number of fuels on the list published under subclause (II) as of the date of consideration. Nothing in this clause shall be construed to have any effect regarding any available authority of States to require the use of any fuel additive registered in accordance with subsection (b), including any fuel additive registered in accordance with subsection (b) after the enactment of this subclause. (I) The provisions of clause (vi), including the limitations of the authority of the Administrator and the cap on the total number of fuels permitted, shall remain in effect until the harmonization of fuels under subclause V of this clause is accomplished. Once such harmonization has been accomplished, clause (v) shall sunset and the limitations of the authority of the Administrator under subclause (IV) of this clause shall apply.

The list shall be referred to as the `Federal Fuels List' and shall include one Federal on-road diesel fuel (which shall grandfather the sulfur phase down in the Administrator's ultra low sulfur diesel fuel regulations in effect as of the date of enactment and shall permit the implementation of one alternative diesel fuel, approved under this subparagraph before enactment of this subclause for a State that has not received a section 209, one conventional gasoline for ozone attainment areas, one reformulated gasoline (RFG) meeting the requirements of subsection (k), and 2 additional gasolines with Reid vapor pressure (RVP) controls for use in ozone attainment areas of varying degrees of severity. None of the fuels identified under this subclause shall control fuel sulfur or toxics levels beyond levels required by regulations of the Administrator. Gasolines and diesel fuels shall be included on the Federal Fuels List based on the Administrator's analysis of their ability to reduce ozone emissions to assist States in attaining established ozone standards under this Act, and on an analysis by the Secretary that the adoption of the Federal Fuels List will not result in a reduction in supply or in producibility, including that caused by a reduction in domestic refining capacity as a result of the adoption of the Federal Fuels List. In the event the Secretary concludes that adoption of the Federal Fuels List will result in a reduction in supply or in producibility, the Administrator and the Secretary shall report that conclusion to Congress, and suspend implementation of this clause. The Administrator and the Secretary shall conduct the study required under section 1541(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 on the timetable required in that section to provide Congress with legislative recommendations for modifications to the proposed Federal Fuels List only if the Secretary concludes that adoption of the Federal Fuels List will result in a reduction in supply or in producibility.

The Administrator's finding shall include an assessment of reasonably foreseeable supply or distribution emergencies that could occur in the affected area or contiguous area and how adoption of the particular fuel revisions would effect alternative supply options during reasonably foreseeable supply or distribution emergencies. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, shall develop a plan to harmonize the currently approved fuels in State implementation plans with the fuels included on the Federal Fuels List and shall promulgate implementing regulations for this plan not later than 18 months after enactment of this subclause.

The Attorney General, in determining whether an alleged violator's price was unreasonably excessive, shall consider whether the price reasonably reflected additional costs, not within the control of that person or company, that were paid, incurred, or reasonably anticipated by that person or company. The price reasonably reflected additional risks taken by that person or company to produce, distribute, obtain, or sell such product under the circumstances. There is a gross disparity between the challenged price and the price at which the same or similar goods were readily available in the same region and during the same Presidentially declared market shortage. The marginal benefit received by the wholesaler or distributor is significantly changed in comparison with marginal earnings in the year before a market shortage was declared. The price charged was comparable to the price at which the goods were generally available in the trade area if the wholesaler or distributor did not sell or offer to sell the prescription drug in question prior to the time a market shortage was declared. And the price was substantially attributable to local, regional, national, or international market conditions. Consultation. Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Attorney General or designee, shall consult with representatives of the National Association of Wholesalers, Group Purchasing Organizations, Pharmaceutical Distributors, Hospitals, Manufacturers, patients, and other interested community organizations to reassess the criteria set forth in subsection (a) in determining unreasonably excessive and prepare and submit to Congress a report on the results of the reassessment. <SECTION-HEADER> DURATION. In General. Any market shortage declared by the President in accordance with this Act shall be in effect for a period of not to exceed 6 months from the date on which the President issues the Executive order. Termination. Any market shortage declared by the President in accordance with this Act shall terminate if there is enacted a law terminating the market shortage which shall be passed by Congress after a national market shortage is declared, or the President issues a proclamation terminating the market shortage. Whichever comes first. Declaration Renewal. The President may renew the state of market shortage declared under subsection (a), if the President declares that the severe shortage continues to affect the health and well being of citizens beyond the initial 6-month period.","summary":"Protecting Patients and Hospitals From Price Gouging Act - Authorizes the President to issue an executive order declaring a market shortage for six months with regard to one or more vital drugs if the total supply of all clinically interchangeable versions of a drug regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is inadequate to meet the current or projected demand at the user level. Defines a vital drug as any drug or biologic used to prevent or treat a serious or life-threatening disease or medical condition, for which there is no other available source with sufficient supply available. Makes it unlawful, when the President issues such an executive order, for any person to sell vital drugs at a price that: (1) is unreasonably excessive, and (2) indicates that the seller is taking unfair advantage of the circumstances related to a market shortage to increase prices unreasonably during that period. Gives the Attorney General authority to enforce penalties under this Act. Makes any person who sells, or offers to sell, any vital drug during a declared market shortage with the knowledge and intent to charge a price unreasonably excessive under the circumstances guilty of an offense and subject to injunction and penalties. Applies such sanctions, except to a hospital or a physician, in the geographical area where the vital drug market shortage has been declared and to all wholesalers and distributors in the chain of distribution. Sets forth factors for the Attorney General to consider in determining whether an alleged violator's price was unreasonably excessive. Makes a declaration under this Act terminate if: (1) there is enacted a law terminating the market shortage after a national market shortage is declared, or (2) the President issues a proclamation terminating the declaration. Authorizes the President to renew such a market shortage declaration if the severe shortage continues to affect the health and well-being of citizens beyond the initial six-month period."}

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Indian Dams Safety Act of 1994\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds that the Secretary of the Interior has identified 53 dams on Indian lands that present a threat to human life in the event of a failure. Because of inadequate attention in the past to problems stemming from structural deficiencies and regular maintenance requirements for dams operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, unsafe Bureau dams continue to pose an imminent threat to people and property. Many Bureau dams have maintenance deficiencies regardless of their current safety condition classification and the deficiencies must be corrected to avoid future threats to human life and property. Safe working dams on Indian lands are necessary to supply irrigation water, to provide flood control, to provide water for municipal, industrial, domestic, livestock, and recreation uses, and for fish and wildlife habitats. And it is necessary to institute a regular dam maintenance and repair program, utilizing the expertise in the Bureau, Indian tribes, and other Federal agencies. <SECTION-HEADER> DEFINITIONS. As used in this Act: The term \"Bureau\" means the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The term \"dam\" has the same meaning given such term by the first section of Public Law 92-367 .

No existing or potential dam safety deficiencies are recognized. Safe performance is expected under all anticipated conditions. Fair. No existing dam safety deficiencies are recognized for normal loading conditions. Infrequent hydrologic or seismic events would probably result in a dam safety deficiency. Conditionally poor. A potential dam safety deficiency is recognized for unusual loading conditions that may realistically occur during the expected life of the structure. Poor. A potential dam safety deficiency is clearly recognized for normal loading conditions. Immediate actions to resolve the deficiency are recommended. Reservoir restrictions may be necessary until resolution of the problem. Unsatisfactory. A dam safety deficiency exists for normal loading conditions. Immediate remedial action is required for resolution of the problem. Risk hazard classification. The risk hazard classification referred to in paragraph (1) is one of the following classifications: High. Six or more lives would be at risk or extensive property damage could occur if the dam failed. Significant. Between one and six lives would be at risk or significant property damage could occur if the dam failed. Low. No lives would be at risk and limited property damage would occur if the dam failed. Limitation on Program Authorization. Work authorized by this Act shall be for the purpose of dam safety maintenance and structural repair. The Secretary may authorize, upon request of an Indian tribe, up to 20 percent of the cost of repairs to be used to provide additional conservation storage capacity or developing benefits beyond those provided by the original dams and reservoirs. This Act is not intended to preclude development of increased storage or benefits under any other authority or to preclude measures to protect fish and wildlife. Technical Assistance. To carry out the purposes of this Act, the Secretary may obtain technical assistance on a nonreimbursable basis from other departments and agencies. Notwithstanding any such technical assistance, the Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program established under subsection (a) shall be under the direction and control of the Bureau.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed to require a State that does not have licensing requirements for independent claims adjusters to adopt any such requirements. Subject to section 6, limit the right of a State to establish licensing fees or enforce its laws regarding the adjusting of insurance claims, provided that such fee is uniform regardless of the State of residence of the licensee.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS. Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended by adding at the end the following: \"PART L MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS \"Section 10993. FINDINGS. \"Congress finds the following: Although 7,500,000 children under the age of 18 require mental health services, fewer than 1 in 5 of these children receive the services. Across the United States, counseling professionals are stretched thin, and often students do not get the help the students need. The current national average ratio of students to counselors in elementary and secondary schools is 513:1. United States schools need more mental health professionals, and the flexibility to hire the professionals that will best serve their students. The maximum recommended ratio of students to counselors is 250:1, students to psychologists is 1,000:1. And students to social workers is 800:1. In States like California or Minnesota, 1 counselor typically serves more than 1,000 students. In some schools, no counselor is available to assist students in times of crisis, or at any other time. In Colorado, the average student-to- counselor ratio is 645:1. The number of students is expected to grow significantly over the next few years. During this time, many school-based mental health professionals who currently serve our Nation's youth will retire. Not counting these retirements, over 100,000 new school counselors will be needed to decrease the student-to-counselor ratio to 250:1 by the year 2005. The Federal support for reducing the student-to- counselor ratio would pay for itself, through reduced incidences of death, violence, and substance abuse, and through improvements in students' academic achievement, graduation rates, college attendance, and employment. \"Section 10993A. PURPOSE. \"The purpose of this part is to help States and local educational agencies recruit, train, and hire 141,000 additional school-based mental health personnel, including 100,000 additional counselors, 21,000 additional school psychologists, and 20,000 additional school social workers over a 5-year period to reduce the student-to-counselor ratios nationally, in elementary and secondary schools, to an average of 1 school counselor for every 250 students 1 school psychologist for every 1,000 students, and 1 social worker for every 800 students. As recommended in a report by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences relating to schools and health, issued in 1997. To help adequately address the mental, emotional, and developmental needs of elementary and secondary school students.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. FINDINGS. Short Title. This Act may be cited as the \"Social Security and Medicare Lock-Box Act\". Findings Regarding Social Security and Medicare Part A. The Congress finds the following: (A) Long term projections show serious problems facing the fiscal health of the trust funds associated with Social Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance. According to the 2012 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds, the assets of the combined Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted by 2033, and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund alone will be depleted by 2016. According to the 2012 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds, the assets of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted by 2024. (A) The Trustees of these trust funds strongly encourage action to protect the solvency of the trust funds. In their message to the public, included in the 2012 Annual Reports, the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees wrote, \"Lawmakers should not delay addressing the long-run financial challenges facing Social Security and Medicare. If they take action sooner rather than later, more options and more time will be available to phase in changes so that the public has adequate time to prepare.\". Social Security and Medicare are meant to provide a secure and stable base so that older Americans can live in dignity. Protecting the future surpluses of these trust funds can only occur when meaningful reform has been enacted by Congress. Any path to solvency must include the protection of future surpluses. <SECTION-HEADER> INTERIM PROTECTIONS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND SURPLUS.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Breast Implant Research and Information Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Findings. Congress makes the following findings: According to the Institute of Medicine, it is estimated that 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 American women have received breast implants over the last 35 years. Because there has never been a patient registry for breast implant recipients it is impossible to more accurately determine the number of women who have received breast implants. Yet, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons estimates that in 1999 alone 82,975 women had breast reconstruction following mastectomies and another 167,318 American women received breast implants for cosmetic purposes. From 1985 until January 2000, FDA received 127,770 adverse reaction reports for silicone gel-filled breast implants and 65,720 adverse reaction reports for saline-filled implants. Women need complete and accurate information about the potential health risks and advantages of breast implants so that women can make informed decisions. Silicone breast implants have never been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Saline breast implants, which consist of a saline solution injected into a silicone envelope, were approved by the agency in 2000 despite alarmingly high complication and reoperation rates. After three years, 43 percent of the augmentation patients and 73 percent of the reconstruction patients experienced local complications and 40 percent of the reconstruction patients were forced to undergo additional surgery for local complications and device failure. In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration opened a criminal investigation following allegations that one of the breast implant manufacturers was manipulating research data in breast implant studies. When the Food and Drug Administration's General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel convened in March 2000 to consider market approval for saline implants, it was not informed of the investigation. Although the manufacturer's saline breast implant was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in May 2000, the investigation remains open. According to a 1997 Mayo Clinic study, within 5 years of receiving such implants, 1 in 4 women required additional surgery. In 2000, research sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration found that even among women who had not sought medical treatment for implant problems, almost 70 percent had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years. Silicone was found to be migrating away from the implants in 21 percent of those women. The FDA researchers concluded that \"the relationship of free silicone to development or progression of disease is unknown\". A 1993 study by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al. University of California, published in The Journal of Autoimmunity, investigated the influence of silicone breast implants on the expression of anticollagen antibodies and found a statistically significant incidence of anticollagen antibodies in women with implants. The researchers concluded that silicone breast implants should not be considered a benign or immunologically inert material. Serious implications may result from their use. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study of silicone breast implant safety found that local complications with silicone breast implants were the primary safety issue, that they have not been well studied, and that information on these complications is crucial for women deciding whether or not they want breast implant surgery. Concern remains that exposure to silicone breast implants may result in currently undefined connective tissue or autoimmune diseases. A 2001 National Cancer Institute study found breast implant recipients suffer from higher rates of lung and brain cancer than other plastic surgery patients. A 1999 case report by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al. University of California, published in The Journal of Rheumatology, found evidence of silicone migration in women with ruptured or leaking silicone breast implants. These patients experienced severe local inflammation and complications resulting from silicone migration to the axilla, arm or abdominal wall. Researchers concluded that once silicone gel leaves the implant, it is not biologically inert and in some persons can elicit profound pathologic responses. According to many reports, including a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the presence of a silicone breast implant may create difficulties in obtaining accurate and thorough mammograms because as much as 40 percent of the breast tissue can be masked by the implant. This delays the early detection of breast cancer in women. According to a 2000 Food and Drug Administration publication, women of childbearing age who want to breast feed should be aware of the negative impact of breast implants on breast feeding. It is not known if a small amount of silicone may pass from the silicone shell of an implant into breast milk. If this occurs, it is not known what effect it may have on the nursing infant. Purpose. It is the purpose of this Act to promote research to identify and evaluate the health effects of breast implants, to ensure that women receive accurate information about such implants and to encourage the Food and Drug Administration to conclude its criminal investigation based on the allegations of wrong-doing by one of the implant manufacturers which ultimately may affect their products and the health of American women. Rule of Construction. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any rule or regulation promulgated under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that is in effect on the date of enactment of this Act relating to the availability of silicone breast implant for reconstruction after mastectomy, correction of congenital deformities, or replacement for ruptured silicone implants for augmentation. <SECTION-HEADER> EXPANSION AND INTENSIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES REGARDING SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Economic Growth and Development Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: The promotion of sustainable economic growth is the only long-term solution to lifting people out of poverty and addressing development challenges such as infectious disease, food security, access to education, and access to clean water, as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit on September 25, 2015. Several of the greatest development success stories of the past 50 years demonstrate that private sector investment and economic growth are fundamental to lifting populations out of poverty. A dramatic shift in the composition of capital flows to the developing world necessitates a new approach to official development assistance. Whereas 40 years ago more than 70 percent of capital flowing to developing countries was public sector foreign assistance, today over 80 percent of capital flowing to the developing world comes from the private sector. In order to better leverage United States foreign assistance dollars and to promote sustainable economic development in partner countries, the United States Government must seek to promote economic growth through private sector investment by consulting United States business during development planning and programming processes. Eleven of the 15 largest importers of United States goods and services are countries that graduated from United States foreign assistance, and 12 of the 15 fastest growing markets for United States exports are former United States foreign assistance recipients. With 12 departments, 26 agencies, and more than 60 Federal Government offices involved in the delivery of United States foreign assistance and the promotion of United States investment overseas, it is unnecessarily difficult for United States businesses to navigate this bureaucracy in search of opportunities to partner with such United States agencies. Although many United States development agencies have taken steps to improve the private sector coordination capabilities of such agencies in recent years, these agency- specific strategies are not integrated into a coherent interagency coordination structure to effectively engage the private sector. The United States Government has no streamlined, interagency mechanism for coordination with the private sector for the purposes of development or promotion of opportunities for investment, nor are the activities of the United States Government in this area guided by a coherent set of strategic objectives, targets, or operating principles. Whether in the context of a country, sector, or global development strategy, decisions regarding program prioritization and resource allocation would benefit greatly from private sector perspectives and market data and coordination with the private sector from the outset. Development programs can be designed to better attract private sector investment and to promote public-private partnerships in key development sectors. The Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Partnership for Growth both analyze constraints on growth as part of the planning processes of these organizations, but these analyses need to be included in agency country, sector, and global development strategies to more effectively inform and guide the full spectrum of United States development programs. <SECTION-HEADER> DEFINITIONS. In this Act: Administrator. The term \"Administrator\" means the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. Appropriate congressional committees. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" means the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate. And the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives. Private sector. The term \"private sector\" means for- profit United States businesses. Secretary. The term \"Secretary\" means the Secretary of State. United states development agencies. The term \"United States development agencies\" means the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency, the Inter-American Foundation. And the African Development Foundation. <SECTION-HEADER> PURPOSE. The purpose of this Act is to maximize the impact of United States development programs by enhancing coordination between United States development agencies and the programs of such agencies and the private sector and the investment activities of the private sector. Integrating private sector input into the planning and programming processes of United States development agencies. Institutionalizing analyses of constraints on growth and investment throughout the planning and programming processes of United States development agencies. Ensuring United States development agencies are accountable for improving coordination between United States development programs and private sector investment activities. And promoting and facilitating private sector investment. <SECTION-HEADER> SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE. It is the sense of Congress that United States development assistance should be pursued in a way that aims to build and strengthen civic institutions, to provide for public accountability. And to serve as the basis for a democratic social contract between the people and their government, and as a basis for graduation from assistance. United States Government policies and decisions should be guided by clear benchmarks for the evaluation of partner country commitment to funding development priorities, including the \"investing in people\" metric of the Millennium Challenge Corporation. United States Government programs should be guided by a unified strategy, ambitious targets, and a robust monitoring, evaluation, and public accountability plan. United States development assistance should aim to help build the capacity of partner countries to raise and commit partner country resources toward development goals, including the capacity to increase revenues, transparent budgeting and expenditures, policies and laws that increase domestic investment. And the ability to address the illicit flows of capital from domestic and international sources. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, reached at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, and the emphasis of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on economic growth and the commitment of greater domestic resources towards development goals, serves as a basis for concrete actions by donors and partner countries to achieve greater accountability and to foster broad-based economic growth and the establishment of prosperous, middle class-based societies. Domestic resource commitments and domestic resource mobilization for development purposes provide a greater chance for sustainability and an alignment of incentives among stakeholders, including donors, partner countries, citizens, and the private sector that drives economic growth. The domestic resource commitments described in paragraph (6) are opportunities to provide for greater accountability and the building of strong, just social contracts between people and their governments, allowing governments to raise revenue, address citizen priorities, and be held accountable for results. Fostering domestic capacity and domestic responsibility for outcomes is the basis of true country ownership and a transition from assistance to sustainability by achieving development goals. Public sector development finance programs, which mobilize private capital to achieve development objectives, are projected to soon overtake traditional grant-based assistance as measured by total capital investments, reflecting an increasing recognition by both donor and recipient countries of the potential that development finance holds for driving inclusive, sustainable economic growth. United States development finance programs should be used for development purposes, complement but not displace private capital, and operate free of political agendas. While the United States has the ability to carry out development finance programs through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Development Credit Authority of the United States Agency for International Development, and the United States Trade and Development Agency, that ability is under-appreciated as a matter of policy and underutilized as a matter of development strategy. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation lacks certain development finance tools, including the ability to make limited equity investments in projects rather than issuing debt and the authority and resources to provide first-loss guarantees or technical assistance. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation is also limited by uncertainty around the renewal of its legal authorities and would be more effective with the stability and predictability provided by a multi-year authorization and a reformulation of how the agency may use its proceeds for essential staff and overhead expenses while still returning money to the Treasury. And United States development assistance should prioritize and better coordinate resources that support enhanced trade capacity and facilitate fairer and more sustainable trade with partner countries. <SECTION-HEADER> INTERAGENCY STRATEGY AND MECHANISM TO COORDINATE UNITED STATES DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES. In General. The President shall establish a primary, interagency mechanism to assist the private sector in coordinating United States development programs with private sector investment activities.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> ESTABLISHMENT OF WORKFORCE SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT LOAN PROGRAM. In General. Part B of title III of the Job Training Partnership Act is amended by adding at the end the following new section: \"Section 327. WORKFORCE SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT LOAN PROGRAM. Findings and Purposes. Findings. The Congress finds that the changing nature of the workforce in the United States is forcing more and more workers to obtain skills upgrading to keep pace. Employees who receive formal skills upgrading enjoy earning advantages of 25 percent or more over those with no such upgrading. The return on investment from formal training through increased productivity is equivalent to 3 times the cost of such training. Approximately 40 percent of business executives say they cannot modernize their equipment due to worker skill deficiencies. Companies cite the lack of funds as a major reason for failure to establish and carry out workforce skills upgrading programs. Although the training of the workforce in the United States is a national concern of utmost importance, limited resources at the Federal level make it infeasible to effectively and efficiently address this concern alone. And States, employers, and representatives of employees need to share the responsibility in providing skills upgrading for employees. Purposes. The purposes of this section are to encourage industry-based investment in human resource development that promotes the competitiveness of the Nation's industries through productivity and product quality enhancement. To ensure secure jobs for those who successfully complete skills upgrading. And to supplement, and not supplant, funds available through existing skills upgrading programs conducted by employers, employee representatives, and the government. And to establish programs which will not replace, parallel, supplant, compete with, or duplicate in any way existing skills upgrading programs. Authorization. In general. From amounts reserved under section 302(a)(2) for any fiscal year, the Secretary may use not less than 5 percent, but not more than 10 percent, of such amounts to provide grants to States to provide loans to eligible entities described in paragraph (2) to assist such entities in providing skills upgrading for non-managerial employees.

In carrying out such program, the State shall meet the following requirements: Establishment of reserve fund for loan guarantees. The State shall establish a reserve fund from amounts received from such grant for the purpose of making commitments to guarantee the payment of principal and interest on loans made by financial institutions to such eligible entities to provide skills upgrading for non-managerial employees. Criteria for loan guarantees. The State, in conjunction with appropriate financial institutions, shall establish and publish criteria for providing loan guarantees to eligible entities under the program, including criteria that provides for the following: A loan guarantee may be issued under the program only if, at the time such guarantee is issued the eligible entity agrees to pay as an insurance premium an amount equal to 1 percent of the principal received by such entity under the loan to the State's reserve fund.

And training to improve basic skills, including reading, writing, and arithmatic. In providing such skills upgrading, the eligible entity shall give priority to non-managerial employees who directly produce or deliver goods or services. Or are in danger of being terminated or laid off as a result of modernization in the workplace, corporate downsizing, foreign or domestic competition, or Federal policies adversely affecting 1 or more industries. Amounts from a loan shall not be used to pay the wages or other benefits of any employee receiving assistance under the program. Payment by state to financial institutions in cases of default. In general. In accordance with criteria developed by the Secretary, the State shall make payments from the State's reserve fund to financial institutions that have provided loans to eligible entities that have defaulted on such loans for the purpose of reimbursing such institutions for the amount of principal and interest remaining unpaid to the institutions by reason of such default. No full faith and credit of the united states.

The Congress finds the following: The world's rhinoceros population is declining at an alarming rate, a 90 percent decline since 1970. All rhinoceros species have been listed on Appendix I of CITES since 1977. All rhinoceros species, except the southern subspecies of white rhinoceros, are listed as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 . In 1987, the parties to CITES adopted a resolution that urged all parties to establish a moratorium on the sale and trade in rhinoceros products , to destroy government stockpiles of rhinoceros horn, and to exert pressure on countries continuing to allow trade in rhinoceros products. On September 7, 1993, under section 8 of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 the Secretary certified that the People's Republic of China and Taiwan were engaged in trade of rhinoceros parts and tiger parts that diminished the effectiveness of an international conservation program for that endangered species. On September 9, 1993, the Standing Committee of CITES, in debating the continuing problem of trade in rhinoceros horn, adopted a resolution urging parties to CITES to implement stricter domestic measures, up to and including an immediate prohibition in trade in wildlife species. <SECTION-HEADER> PURPOSES.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Pakistani Temporary Protected Status Act of 2010\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: The summer of 2010 produced Pakistan's worst flooding in 80 years. The 2010 Pakistani floods began in July 2010 following heavy monsoon rains in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan regions of Pakistan and affected the Indus River basin. Flooding began on July 22, 2010, in the province of Baluchistan. According to the United Nations, 20,000,000 people, one-eighth of the population, and nearly 62,000 square miles, one-fifth of the country, have been significantly affected by destruction of property, livelihood, and infrastructure. The Pakistani Government reports that the floods have affected 82 of Pakistan's 122 districts. As a result, more than 12 million people require humanitarian assistance, with nearly 6 million victims lacking access to food, shelter, and water. The Pakistani Government estimates that approximately 1.9 million houses were either damaged or destroyed and nearly 2,000 people have lost their lives. Over 60,000 troops are involved in Pakistan's flood relief operations. The floods severely devastated Pakistan's infrastructure including roads, bridges, schools, health clinics, electricity, and communications. More than 5,000 miles of roads and railways were washed away, along with some 7,000 schools and more than 400 health facilities. In addition, about 17 million acres of Pakistan's most fertile croplands have been submerged by the floods, in a nation where farming is an economic mainstay. The waters have also killed more than 200,000 head of livestock, and washed away large quantities of stored commodities that feed millions throughout the year. On August 14, 2010, the first documented case of cholera emerged in the town of Mingora. On September 7, 2010, the International Labour Organization reported that more than 5.3 million jobs have been lost due to the floods. Concerns are growing about the enduring toll of the disaster on Pakistan's overall economy, food supply, and political stability. Temporary protected status allows aliens who do not legally qualify as refugees but are nonetheless fleeing or reluctant to return to potentially dangerous situations to temporarily remain in the United States. Granting temporary protected status to nationals of Pakistan is consistent with the interests of the United States and promotes the values and morals that have made the United States strong. <SECTION-HEADER> SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of the Congress that the extraordinary and temporary conditions caused by flooding in Pakistan qualifies Pakistan for designation under subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 244(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USC. 1254a(b)(1)), pursuant to which nationals of Pakistan would be eligible for temporary protected status in the United States. <SECTION-HEADER> DESIGNATION FOR PURPOSES OF GRANTING TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS. Designation. In general. For purposes of section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act , Pakistan shall be treated as if it had been designated under subsection of such section, subject to the provisions of this section. Period of designation. The initial period of such designation shall begin on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall remain in effect for 12 months. Aliens Eligible. In applying section 244 of such Act pursuant to the designation made under this section, subject to section 244(c)(3) of such Act, an alien who is a national of Pakistan is deemed to satisfy the requirements of section 244(c)(1) of such Act only if the alien has been continuously physically present in the United States since July 22, 2010. Is admissible as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under section 244(c)(2)(A) of such Act, and is not ineligible for temporary protected status under section 244(c)(2)(B) of such Act. And registers for temporary protected status in a manner that the Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish. Consent To Travel Abroad. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall give the prior consent to travel abroad described in section 244(f)(3) of such Act to an alien who is granted temporary protected status pursuant to the designation made under this section, if the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Homeland Security that emergency and extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the alien require the alien to depart for a brief, temporary trip abroad. An alien returning to the United States in accordance with such an authorization shall be treated the same as any other returning alien provided temporary protected status under section 244 of such Act.","summary":"Pakistani Temporary Protected Status Act of 2010 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the extraordinary and temporary conditions caused by flooding in Pakistan qualifies Pakistan for designation under the Immigration and Nationality Act pursuant to which its nationals would be eligible for temporary protected status (TPS) in the United States.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"National Capital Area Interest Arbitration Standards Act of 1995\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. Findings. The Congress finds that affordable public transportation is essential to the economic vitality of the national capital area and is an essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality to meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of both residents of and visitors to the national capital area as well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation's capital. Use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors to the national capital area is substantially affected by the prices charged for such mass transit services, prices that are substantially affected by labor costs, since more than 23 of operating costs are attributable to labor costs. Labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are among the highest in the Nation. Higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public transit. Spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public transit services since local governments generally, and the District of Columbia government in particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints. Imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase. And Federal legislation is necessary under Article I of section 8 of the United States Constitution to balance the need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace. Purpose. It is therefore the purpose of this Act to adopt standards governing arbitration which must be applied by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area. <SECTION-HEADER> DEFINITIONS. As used in this Act the term \"arbitration\" means the arbitration of disputes, regarding the terms and conditions of employment, that is required under an interstate compact governing an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"National Aviation Research and Competitiveness Act of 1993\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds that for every dollar increase in shipments of United States aircraft internationally, the United States economy output increases by an estimated $2.30. For every $1,000,000,000 of aircraft shipments internationally, nearly 35,000 jobs are created. Many of the advanced aviation technologies developed by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Defense have application in security, safety, capacity, communications, and air traffic control. A decrease in military aviation programs will have a negative impact on civil aviation programs. Research programs at the Federal Aviation Administration have potential applications in both civil and military aviation. Joint technology development programs among the Department of Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration, and industry would allow for transferring skills and technologies from the defense to the civilian aviation sector and would allow for the transfer back to defense, when necessary. And such joint programs could allow for the Department of Defense contribution to the programs to be phased out over 5 years, which would allow the defense industry to make the transfer to the civilian aviation sector and produce needed aviation technology. <SECTION-HEADER> JOINT AVIATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. Establishment. The Administrator and the Secretary shall jointly establish a program for the purpose of conducting research on aviation technologies that have application to both military and civil aviation vehicles and airports and that enhance United States competitiveness. Such program shall include research on next-generation satellite communications, including global positioning satellites, advanced airport and airplane security. Environmentally compatible technologies, including technologies that limit or reduce noise and air pollution. And advanced aviation safety programs. Contracts and Grants. Contracts and grants entered into under the program established under subsection (a) shall be administered using procedures developed jointly by the Secretary and the Administrator. These procedures should include an integrated acquisition policy for contract and grant requirements and for technical data rights that are not an impediment to joint programs among the Department of Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration, and industry. <SECTION-HEADER> JOINT AVIATION RESEARCH PLAN. Requirement. Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator and the Secretary, in consultation with the advisory committee, shall prepare and transmit to Congress a national aviation research plan setting forth the research and development that the Administrator and the Secretary consider necessary to advance aviation technologies over the 5-year period beginning in fiscal year 1993. Objectives of Plan. The objectives of the plan prepared under subsection (a) shall include selected programs that jointly enhance public and private aviation technology development. An opportunity for private defense contractors to be involved in transition activities to the civilian sector. And the transfer of Federal Government-developed technologies to the private sector to promote economic strength and competitiveness. Contents of Plan. The plan prepared under subsection (a) shall include for the first year, detailed objectives and estimates of the schedule, cost, and manpower levels for each research project, and a description of the scope and content of each major contract or grant. For the second through fifth years, estimates of the total cost of each major project for such year and a list of all major research projects which may be required to meet the objectives. A 5-year schedule for the decrease of Federal contribution and corresponding increase in private sector contributions for the research and development program. And the portion of the Federal contribution that each Federal agency will contribute. Annual Update. The plan prepared under subsection (a) shall be updated annually, to reflect changes in global aviation technologies and United States competitiveness. <SECTION-HEADER> JOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. Establishment. Within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator and the Secretary shall establish an Joint Aviation Research Advisory Committee. Purposes. The purposes of the advisory committee shall be to provide advice and recommendations to the Administrator and the Secretary regarding needs, objectives, approaches, content, and accomplishments with respect to the aviation research program established under section 3. And to advise the Administrator and the Secretary on the preparation of the aviation research plan under section 4, including annual updates thereto. Membership.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Economic Espionage and Protection of Proprietary Economic Information Act of 1995\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Findings. Congress finds that sustaining a healthy and competitive national economy is imperative to maintaining the security of the Nation. The development and production of proprietary economic information is an integral part of virtually every aspect of United States trade, commerce, and business. The development, production, protection, and lawful exchange, sale, and transfer of proprietary economic information is essential to maintaining the health and competitiveness of critical segments of United States business and industry, and hence to the national economy and the national security. Much proprietary economic information moves in interstate and foreign commerce, and proprietary economic information that does not move in interstate or foreign commerce directly affects that which does. The theft, misappropriation, and wrongful receipt, transfer, exchange, and use of stolen or misappropriated proprietary economic information by foreign governments and their agents or instrumentalities costs the United States Government and United States firms, businesses, industries, and consumers millions of dollars each year. The theft, misappropriation, and wrongful receipt, transfer, and use of proprietary economic information belonging to the United States Government and United States firms, businesses, and industry by foreign governments and their agents or instrumentalities directly and substantially threatens the health and competitiveness of critical segments of the United States economy and, consequently, the Nation's security. And enforcement of existing State laws protecting proprietary economic information is frustrated by the ease with which stolen or wrongfully appropriated proprietary economic information is transferred across State and national boundaries. Purposes. Primary purpose. The primary purpose of this Act is to protect the national security by preventing economic espionage and furthering the development and lawful use of United States proprietary economic information by protecting it from theft, wrongful destruction or alteration, misappropriation, and conversion by foreign governments and their agents or instrumentalities. This Act is intended to protect the proprietary economic information of the United States Government and United States firms, businesses, industries, and individuals both domestically and abroad by punishing individuals, corporations, and institutions which engage in economic espionage with the intent or purpose of aiding foreign nations or governments and their instrumentalities. Secondary purpose. The secondary purpose of this Act is to affirm that proprietary economic information is included in the term \"goods, wares, or merchandise\" as that term is used in Federal laws relating to stolen property. <SECTION-HEADER> PREVENTION OF ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE AND PROTECTION OF PROPRIETARY ECONOMIC INFORMATION IN INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN COMMERCE.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Protect the Homeland from North Korean and Iranian Ballistic Missiles Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: The United States Constitution indicates one of the first purposes of government is to provide for the defense of the American people. North Korea continues to develop the Taepo Dong 2 long- range missile. The United States intelligence community estimated that the Taepo Dong 2, when fully developed, could threaten the entire continental United States with a ballistic missile. North Korea tested the Taepo Dong 2 missile over the Sea of Japan on July 4, 2006, in defiance of warnings from the United States, Japan, South Korea, and the People's Republic of China. North Korea, in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1695 and 1718, launched a long range ballistic missile on April 5, 2009. This test demonstrates that North Korean long range ballistic missiles can now reach South Korea, Japan, and Guam and can travel 2,000 miles over Japan into the Pacific Ocean. North Korea ordered inspectors out of the country and walked away from the 6 party talks on April 14, 2009. North Korea has deployed the Musudan intermediate range ballistic missile which can threaten Okinawa and Guam, 200 No Dong missiles which can reach Japan, and 600 Scud missiles which threaten South Korea. On April 29, 2009, North Korea threatened to conduct a nuclear test and an intercontinental ballistic missile unless the United Nations Security Council apologized for imposing sanctions against North Korea. North Korea, in violation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1718, conducted a nuclear test on May 25, 2009. North Korea's missile launch and nuclear test demonstrate present international diplomatic efforts are not sufficient to deter North Korea from developing, deploying, and launching missiles or developing nuclear technology. North Korea has test-fired six short-range missiles off the country's east coast since the May 25, 2009, nuclear test. Recently North Korea has asserted it is no longer bound by the armistice which ended the Korean War and has threatened war against the United States, South Korea, and Japan. North Korea leads the world in missile proliferation. North Korea is known to share ballistic missile technology with other weapons proliferating nations such as Iran. North Korea aided Syria with its nuclear program. The Director of the Missile Defense Agency said on June 9, 2009, \"The United States has fine-tuned its ability to shoot down long-range missiles that could be launched by North Korea based on a trio of tests mimicking such an attack.\". On February 3, 2009, the Government of Iran successfully launched its first satellite into orbit an act in direct violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737. General Maples, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, recently said, \"Iran's February 3, 2009, launch of the Safir space launch vehicle shows progress in mastering technology needed to produce ICBMs.\". On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama said, \"So let me be clear: Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the United States, but to Iran's neighbors and our allies.\". On May 19, 2009, the Government of Iran test-fired a new two-stage, medium-range, solid fuel, surface-to-surface missile, which can reach Europe, Israel, and United States forces deployed in the Persian Gulf Region. <SECTION-HEADER> STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING NORTH KOREA'S AND IRAN'S LONG- RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGY. Congress acknowledges that North Korea's and Iran's long-range ballistic missile technology is improving and could be used to deliver chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. Expresses concern that North Korea's and Iran's long- range ballistic missile technology poses a real threat to the United States homeland. Realizes missile delivery technology and warheads could be passed along to state and non-state actors. And supports ballistic missile protection of United States allies and forward deployed forces but believes it should not come at the expense of the protection of the United States homeland. <SECTION-HEADER> DEPLOYMENT OF MISSILE DEFENSE INTERCEPTORS IN ALASKA AND CALIFORNIA.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Global Trade Requires Unmitigated Truth in Health (TRUTH) Act\" . <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: The rise of global trade has created both new commercial opportunities and new health risks. Governments have the right and responsibility to protect their countries from the threat of disease. Trade is responsible for contributing to the rapid spread of disease around the globe and increases the risk of a pandemic outbreak. Those who participate in world trade, therefore, have a responsibility to promptly report and appropriately respond to infectious diseases on a timely basis to minimize the potential for global pandemics. The World Health Organization has created the World Health Organization International Health Regulations to prevent, protect against, and control disease and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and that avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. The failure of countries to be transparent and responsive to the existence or spread of disease in a country that is a member of the World Trade Organization threatens the free flow of goods and services that is a primary objective of the GATT 1994 and other agreements of the World Trade Organization. The experience with the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003 should be a clear warning that the system of public health readiness can be easily compromised by delays in reporting the earliest cases of an outbreak by a country reluctant to publicize a problem with an economic downside, no matter the public health consequences. If a country fails to abide by regulations which are designed to prevent, protect against, and control disease and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease without unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade, it may be necessary to take actions against that country which restrict or otherwise interfere with international traffic or trade in the best interest of public health. <SECTION-HEADER> WTO PROPOSAL. Action by United States Trade Representative. The United States Trade Representative shall propose to the World Trade Organization that the rights and obligations of the World Trade Organization should take into account whether countries are undermining the trade system by failing to abide by the rules of other international organizations with regard to public health, specifically the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization. And include in the proposal options for its implementation, such as provisions that would give members of the World Trade Organization the right to impose sanctions or other punitive measures on members that have been found to violate the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization. And membership criteria for current and potential members of the World trade Organization that would include the requirement to uphold the trade system by abiding by rules of other international organizations with regard to public health. Report to Congress. The United States Trade Representative shall report to the Congress, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and not later than the end of each 90-day period thereafter, on steps the Trade Representative has taken to carry out subsection (a), and the results of those steps. <SECTION-HEADER> ANNUAL REPORT ON COUNTRY COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS.

Contents. Each report under subsection (a) shall include the following information: The extent to which each country complies with and enforces the requirements contained in the International Health Regulations. The extent to which each country uses effective epidemiological principles to detect, reduce, or eliminate the sources from which infection spreads, to improve sanitation in and around ports and airports, to prevent the dissemination of vectors, and, in general, to encourage epidemiological activities on the national level so that there is little risk of outside infection establishing itself in that country. The steps that the Secretary has taken to alter United States programs or policies with respect to any country because of unsatisfactory compliance with the International Health Regulations. For each country in which the report indicates that the country's health administration has failed to notify the World Health Organization within 24 hours of its being informed that the first case of a disease subject to the International Health Regulations, that is neither an imported case nor a transferred case, has occurred in its territory, or, within the subsequent 24 hours, has failed to notify the infected area, the extent to which the United States has taken or will take action to encourage such notifications. The extent to which each country communicates frequent and detailed information to the World Health Organization about the presence of plague, cholera, yellow fever, avian influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and any other disease determined by the Secretary that is present in its country. The report shall describe whether each country communicates to the World Health Organization the number of cases and deaths at least once each week, and the precautions taken to prevent the spread of the disease, in particular the measures which are being applied to prevent the spread of the disease to other territories by vessels, aircraft, trains, road vehicles, other means of transport, and containers leaving the infected area. What steps the government of each country has taken to ensure that ports and airports in its territory have at their disposal an organization and equipment adequate for the application of the measures provided for in the International Health Regulations. What steps the government of each country has taken to make available, at as many of the ports and airports in a territory as practicable, an organized medical and health service with adequate staff, equipment, and premises, in particular facilities for the prompt isolation and care of infected persons, for disinfection, disinsecting, and deratting, for bacteriological investigation, for the collection and examination of rodents for plague infection, for collection of water and food samples and their dispatch to a laboratory for examination, and for other appropriate measures provided for by the International Health Regulations.","summary":"Global Trade Requires Unmitigated Truth in Health (TRUTH) Act - Requires the US Trade Representative (USTR) to: (1) propose to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that its rights and obligations should take into account whether countries are undermining the trade system by failing to abide by the rules of other international organizations with regard to public health, specifically the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: Cavernous angioma, also termed \"cerebral cavernous malformations\" or \"CCM\", affects an estimated 1,500,000 people in the United States. Cavernous angioma is a devastating blood vessel disease that is characterized by the presence of vascular lesions that develop and grow within the brain and spinal cord. Detection of cavernous angioma lesions is achieved though costly and specialized medical imaging techniques. Cavernous angioma is a common type of vascular anomaly, but individuals may not be aware that they have the disease until the onset of serious clinical symptoms. Individuals diagnosed with cavernous angioma may experience neurological deficits, seizure, stroke, or sudden death. Due to limited research with respect to cavernous angioma, there is no treatment regimen for the disease other than brain and spinal surgery. Some individuals with cavernous angioma are not candidates for brain surgery, and no treatment option is available for such individuals. There is a shortage of physicians who are familiar with cavernous angioma and affected individuals may find it difficult to receive timely diagnosis and appropriate care. Due to the presence of a specific disease-causing mutation, termed the \"common Hispanic mutation\" that has passed through as many as 17 generations of Americans descended from the original Spanish settlers of the Southwest in the 1590s, New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world. Cavernous angioma affects tens of thousands of individuals in New Mexico. Other States with high rates of cavernous angioma include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, agreed to May 13, 2009, which was adopted unanimously, expresses the sense of the Senate that there is a critical need to increase research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health promotes advances in biomedical research by supporting extramural research at institutes of higher education, in part through extramural centers of excellence. These centers promote research through a multidisciplinary, team-based approach in order to better understand complex biomedical systems and translate basic scientific discoveries into useful clinical applications. To address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma in New Mexico and throughout the United States, there is a need for a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center in order to provide a model medical system for other such centers, to facilitate medical research to develop a cure for cavernous angioma, and to enhance the medical care of individuals with cavernous angioma nationwide. Given the existing programs and expertise at the University of New Mexico, the first coordinated, centralized Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center should be established at the University of New Mexico. <SECTION-HEADER> CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA CARE CENTER. Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is amended by adding at the end the following: \"Section 409K. CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA CARE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Findings. Congress makes the following findings: Although title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, one section of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights' 1997 final policy guidance, entitled \"Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties\" published in the Federal Register on March 13, 1997, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, included a determination that \"sexual harassment directed at gay or lesbian students that is sufficiently serious to limit or deny a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program constitutes sexual harassment prohibited by title IX under the circumstances described in this guidance.\". This language was unchanged in a 2001 update of the policy guidance entitled \"Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties\" for which a notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on January 19, 2001, 66 Fed. Reg. 5512. That section of the 2001 \"Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties\" went on to state: \"Though beyond the scope of this guidance, gender-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, but not involving conduct of a sexual nature, is also a form of sex discrimination to which a school must respond, if it rises to the level that denies or limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the educational program.. A school must respond to such harassment in accordance with the standards and procedures described in this guidance.\". There is evidence that brings into question the degree to which the policy guidance on sexual harassment against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students is being implemented. For example, a 7-State study by Human Rights Watch of the abuses suffered by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students at the hands of their peers, published in \"Hatred in the Hallways: Violence and Discrimination Against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Students in US Schools\" found that such students were often the victims of abuses. A 2000 study by the American Association of University Women focused on implementation of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 more generally, and the findings of that study, published in \"A License for Bias: Sex Discrimination, Schools, and Title IX\", included a finding that many schools and universities have not established procedures for handling title IX-based grievances. The 2001 report of the Surgeon General, entitled \"Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior\" notes that \"antihomosexual attitudes are associated with psychological distress for homosexual persons and may have a negative impact on mental health, including a greater incidence of depression and suicide, lower self-acceptance and a greater likelihood of hiding sexual orientation.\". It goes on to report: \"Averaged over two dozen studies, 80 percent of gay men and lesbians had experienced verbal or physical harassment on the basis of their orientation, 45 percent had been threatened with violence, and 17 percent had experienced a physical attack.\". Purpose. The purpose of this Act is to provide for an examination of how secondary schools are implementing the policy guidance of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights related to sexual harassment directed against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students. <SECTION-HEADER> STUDY OF HOW EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY GUIDANCE RELATING TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. In General. The United States Commission on Civil Rights shall conduct a study of the 1997 final policy guidance entitled \"Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties\" published in the Federal Register on March 13, 1997, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, and the application of such policy guidance. Scope. Nationwide. The study shall be conducted nationwide. Elements of study. The study shall examine, at a minimum, with regard to secondary schools the extent to which there exists sexual harassment against gay and lesbian students in secondary schools, using the applicable standards in the policy guidance of the Office for Civil Rights described in subsection (a). The extent to which there exists gender-based harassment that negatively affects the learning environment of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students in secondary schools, applying the definition of such gender-based harassment contained in the 2001 update of the policy guidance entitled \"Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties\" for which a notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on January 19, 2001, 66 Fed. Reg. 5512. The level of awareness by school officials and students of the policy guidance described in subsection. And the level of implementation of such policy guidance. Definition. In this section, the term \"secondary school\" has the meaning given the term in section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 . <SECTION-HEADER> REPORTING OF FINDINGS. In General. Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall transmit to Congress and to the Secretary of Education a report of the Commission's findings under section 2. And any policy recommendations developed by the Commission based upon the study carried out under section 2. Dissemination. The report and recommendations shall be disseminated, in a manner that is easily understandable, to the public by means that include the Internet. <SECTION-HEADER> COOPERATION OF FEDERAL AGENCIES. In General. The head of each Federal department or agency shall cooperate in all respects with the Commission with respect to the study under section 2. Information. The head of each Federal department or agency shall provide to the Commission, to the extent permitted by law, such data, reports, and documents concerning the subject matter of such study as the Commission may request. Definition. In this section, the term \"Federal department or agency\" means any agency as defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code. <SECTION-HEADER> AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. In General. There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act, such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2002. Availability.

The Secretary may make more than one loan under this section to a veteran. The total amount of loans under this section to any veteran may not exceed $10,000. A loan under this section shall bear no interest until the date on which payments on the primary loan are current. Shall be secured by a lien on the property securing the primary loan and by such other security as the Secretary may require.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 1999\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS OF CONGRESS. Congress makes the following findings: Consistent with the rights of the United States under the World Trade Organization, injurious dumping is to be condemned and actionable subsidies which cause injury to domestic industries must be effectively neutralized. United States unfair trade laws have as their purpose the restoration of conditions of fair trade so that jobs and investment that should be in the United States are not lost through the false market signals. The continued dumping or subsidization of imported products after the issuance of antidumping orders or findings or countervailing duty orders can frustrate the remedial purpose of the laws by preventing market prices from returning to fair levels. Where dumping or subsidization continues, domestic producers will be reluctant to reinvest or rehire and may be unable to maintain pension and health care benefits that conditions of fair trade would permit. Similarly, small businesses and American farmers and ranchers may be unable to pay down accumulated debt, to obtain working capital, or to otherwise remain viable. United States trade laws should be strengthened to see that the remedial purpose of those laws is achieved. <SECTION-HEADER> AMENDMENTS TO THE TARIFF ACT OF 1930. In General.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS. The Congress finds that the Martin Luther King, Junior, Historic Site and Preservation District is one of the most significant places in the country dedicated to African-American history. The Martin Luther King, Junior, Historic Site and Preservation District receives the largest number of visitors compared to any other historic site in the State of Georgia and is the 3rd most visited historic site in the National Park Service in the country. The lack of a comprehensive, international context within which to interpret African-American history and culture impedes the ability of all Americans, particularly African- Americans, to understand themselves and their relationship to America's past and its future. African-American history is complex and requires the integration of diverse experiences of African-Americans ranging from slavery and freedom to cultural, scientific and athletic endeavors, through the continued struggles for full participation in our society to reinforce the positive self- image of African-Americans and to develop pride in their past and hope for their future. The expansion of a national museum on African-American history and culture, which will include a wide array of collections from an eclectic group of African-Americans, will help all Americans, and those who visit our country from abroad, better understand and appreciate the significant contributions made by African-Americans to American as well as world history. The African-American Panoramic Experience Museum is located in Atlanta, Georgia, at the gateway to and part of the Martin Luther King, Junior, Historic Site and Preservation District. The APEX houses its own African-American Collection and is the site of exhibitions on African-American art and culture. The Atlanta Fulton County African American Research Library, under construction adjacent to The APEX, is designated by Fulton County to serve as the primary location in the Atlanta region for conducting research related to African- American studies and for fostering academic research initiatives on African-American history and culture. <SECTION-HEADER> REHABILITATION AND EXPANSION OF THE APEX CENTER.

Requirements for Grant. A grant may not be made under subsection (a) unless an application is made to the Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may require. The application shall include provisions designed to ensure that the first floor of the expanded facility can serve as a visitors center for the Martin Luther King, Junior, Historic Site and Preservation District and the surrounding National Park Service parks, to provide an orientation to the sites, activities, and services created to enhance their educational experience. And the facility will serve as an international center to showcase the historical, intellectual, cultural, artistic, scientific, and athletic achievements of African-Americans through galleries, exhibitions, multivideo presentations and an archive collection filled with artifacts and memorabilia that reflect African and African-American life. <SECTION-HEADER> DEFINITIONS.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Colville National Forest Adaptive Management of Timber Resources Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: Forest vegetation on Federal lands in the intermountain West, including eastern Washington and particularly the Colville National Forest in the State of Washington, is in an extremely overstocked condition due to fire exclusion and nonmanagement, resulting in unhealthy, low-vigor stands that are susceptible to disease, insects, and fire. The value of this forest vegetation far exceeds the cost of managing these stands for a healthy, productive ecosystem, but the current regulatory structure of overlapping directives and planning documents hinders management of this forest vegetation in a manner necessary to achieve, simultaneously, healthy and productive ecosystems and community benefits. The current regulatory structure and overall policy direction further hinder the flexibility of the Forest Service to plan and prepare projects that effectively consider local conditions and opportunities or capture market opportunities. Federal budgetary limitations have reduced the trained and experienced Forest Service workforce below the level necessary to plan for and maintain healthy and productive ecosystems. At the same time the Forest Service is forced to spend a disproportionate amount of its resources on planning, with insufficient resources remaining to implement scientifically acceptable forest management activities. Implementation of adaptive management techniques in selected areas of the Colville National Forest will provide a healthy ecosystem, provide for long-term national fiber needs, generate funds in excess of costs, and stimulate the economies of local, resource-dependent communities. The scientific knowledge gained from projects conducted using the adaptive management techniques required under this Act will benefit similar forest stands throughout the intermountain West. The economic knowledge gained from such projects will benefit management projects in all timber stands. <SECTION-HEADER> PURPOSES. The purposes of this Act are the following: To combat the adverse human and environmental consequences of catastrophic wildfire, including immediate-term loss of life, vegetation, soil, water, and nearby land use, and long-term loss of land productivity and continuous resource flow. To use a creditable, science-based, adaptive management approach to manage fire-generated, overstocked, small-diameter, stagnated forest stands to improve forest health, meet current and future environmental needs, and provide wood fiber for processing in dependent communities. To demonstrate the cost-effective use of private contractors to perform substantive planning and plan implementation tasks for the Forest Service. <SECTION-HEADER> PREPARATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION OF ADAPTIVE FOREST MANAGEMENT IN COLVILLE NATIONAL FOREST. Adaptive Management Research Plan Required. Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall prepare and submit to Congress a research plan, including supporting environmental documents, that provides for the implementation and evaluation of controlled silvicultural treatment in fire-generated, overstocked, small-diameter, stagnated forest stands in designated areas of the Colville National Forest in the State of Washington for the purpose of testing the effect of adaptive management techniques in the treatment of such forest stands. Areas Covered by Plan. The research plan prepared under subsection (a) shall apply to the following areas of the Colville National Forest: The approximately 110,000 acres of the Colville National Forest identified as economically suited for adaptive management techniques in the Forest Service study of 1989-1994 regarding creating opportunities. Other lands in the Colville National Forest selected by the Secretary as having characteristics similar to the lands identified in paragraph (1). Implementation of Plan. The Secretary shall implement the research plan prepared under subsection (a) not later than the second full field season beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary may begin an initial demonstration project based on a preliminary draft of the research plan as soon as practicable in an area of approximately 10,000 acres. Use of Private Sector. Subject to the availability of funds for this purpose under subsection (e), the Secretary may use private contractors, including individuals and groups involved in the preparation of the study referred to in subsection (b)(1), in the preparation and implementation of the research plan required under subsection (a) and in monitoring the effects of the research plan under subsection (i). To the greatest extent practicable, such private contractors shall be selected from communities adversely affected by reductions in the timber sale program of the National Forest System. Funding. Establishment of special account. To fund the preparation and implementation of the research plan required under subsection (a), the Secretary shall establish an account to be known as the \"Ecosystem Adaptive Management Demonstration Account\". Funds for account. There shall be allocated or transferred to the account the following: A portion of the amount annually allocated to the Colville National Forest pursuant to any other provision of law, to be based on the proportion of the Colville National Forest subject to the research plan. The amounts deposited pursuant to subsection (3). Any amounts borrowed under paragraph (3). Borrowing authority. To the extent necessary to fund startup costs under the research plan, the Secretary may borrow amounts from salvage sale accounts of the Forest Service or amounts available under the Act of June 9, 1930 . The Secretary shall repay amounts borrowed, without interest, using funds deposited in the account under subsection (g)(3). Use of Account. The Secretary shall use amounts in the special account established under subsection (e) for the design and implementation of research projects conducted under the research plan prepared under subsection , except that the Secretary shall use funds from other sources to cover any costs related to appeals or litigation concerning those projects. And to the extent amounts remain available in the special account after expenditures under paragraph (1), vegetative management activities, fuels treatment, monitoring, and watershed improvement projects within the areas covered by the research plan. Treatment of Receipts. Receipts generated from the sale of forest products resulting from silvicultural treatments under the research plan prepared under subsection (a) shall be deposited or utilized as follows: 25 percent shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury of the United States as a miscellaneous receipt, pursuant to the procedures specified in the fifth paragraph under the heading \"FOREST SERVICE\" in the Act of March 4, 1907 , and related laws. 25 percent shall be provided to the State of Washington pursuant to the procedures specified in the sixth paragraph under the heading \"FOREST SERVICE\" in the Act of May 23, 1908 . 50 percent shall be deposited in the special account established under subsection (e). Schedule of Silvicultural Treatments. Silvicultural treatments under the research plan prepared under subsection (a) shall be conducted during the 10-year period beginning on the date the research plan is first implemented. The total number of acres treated in each of the first 5 years shall not vary by more than 20 percent from 110 of the total acres covered by the research plan. Monitoring and Reports. The Secretary shall commence monitoring of the effects of research activities under the research plan prepared under subsection (a) immediately after implementation of the research plan. Monitoring activities shall continue for a period of not less than 15 years. At 5-year intervals during the monitoring period, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of the monitoring, findings derived from the research projects under the research plan, and the implications of such findings for management of similar overstocked stands. Each report shall include a detailed accounting of direct costs and returns associated with the implementation of the research plan.","summary":"Colville National Forest Adaptive Management of Timber Resources Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct an adaptive forest management research program in Colville National Forest, Washington, which shall include silvicultural treatments.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Vessel Discharge Evaluation and Review Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: Starting with passage of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships in 1980, the United States Coast Guard has been the principal Federal authority charged with administering, enforcing, and prescribing regulations relating to the discharge of pollutants from vessels engaged in maritime commerce and transportation. There are more than 16 million State-registered boats, 110,000 commercial fishing vessels, and 53,000 freight and tank barges operating in United States waters. Since 1973 certain discharges incidental to the normal operation of these vessels have been exempted from regulation. When required, Congress has specifically mandated Federal programs for control of discharges from vessels, including the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships in 1980, the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, the National Invasive Species Act of 1996. And section 1401 of the 2000 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2001, which prevented discharge of treated sewage and graywater in certain areas of Alaska. <SECTION-HEADER> EVALUATION AND REVIEW OF CERTAIN DISCHARGES. In General. The Commandant of the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and the head of any other appropriate agency or department of the United States, shall conduct an evaluation and review of vessel discharges, other than aquatic nuisance species, that are described in section 122.3(a) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on January 5, 1989. The evaluation shall include a characterization of the various types and composition of such discharges by different classes of vessels. The volumes of such discharges for representative individual vessels and by classes of vessels in the aggregate. An analysis of current technologies or best management practices, and their associated costs, used to control such discharges. An analysis of the extent to which such discharges are currently subject to regulation under existing Federal laws or binding international obligations of the United States, the locations of such discharges. Analyses and conclusions as to the nature and extent of potential effects of such discharges on human health, welfare, and the environment. An analysis of practicable measures, including best management practices, to control such discharges. And recommendations as to steps, including regulatory changes, together with a schedule for implementation, that are appropriate to address such discharges. Public Comment. The Commandant shall publish a draft report containing findings, conclusions, and recommendations from the evaluation and review required by subsection (a) in the Federal Register. Accept public comments regarding such draft for a period of not less than 120 days after the date the draft is published in the Federal Register. And consider any such public comments in the preparation of the final report. Final Report. Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commandant shall prepare and submit to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure a final report containing findings, conclusions, and recommendations from the evaluation and review required by subsection (a). <SECTION-HEADER> DISCHARGES INCIDENTAL TO NORMAL OPERATION OF VESSELS. Statement of Purpose. The purposes of this section are to provide for the establishment of nationally uniform, environmentally sound, standards for discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels. And to establish procedures for designation of no discharge zones as necessary to protect waters within the jurisdiction of a State from the effects of discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels. Evaluation and Review of Certain Discharges. Subtitle B of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following: \"Section 1105. REGULATION OF CERTAIN DISCHARGES. In General. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any requirement to obtain a permit for a discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel is suspended beginning on the date of enactment of the Vessel Discharge Evaluation and Review Act. The Commandant of the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere shall promulgate a final rule to establish an appropriate program for establishing enforceable uniform national discharge standards, in lieu of any permit requirement established pursuant to any other provision of law, that are modeled in whole or in part on the regulatory program for vessels of the Armed Forces and based upon the best available technology. Any such national uniform discharge standards or prohibitions shall be enforced by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating and may be enforced by a State. Judicial Review. An interested person may file a petition for review of a final regulation promulgated under this section in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Any such petition shall be filed within 120 days after the date notice of such promulgation appears in the Federal Register, except that if such petition is based solely on grounds arising after such 120th day, then any petition for review under this subsection shall be filed within 120 days after such grounds arise. Any regulation for which review could have been obtained under paragraph (1) of this subsection is not subject to judicial review in any civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement. Effect on State Authority. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except as provided in this subsection, no State or political subdivision thereof may adopt or enforce any statute or regulation of the State or political subdivision with respect to a discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel subject to evaluation under section 3 of the Vessel Discharge Evaluation and Review Act after the promulgation of a final rule under that subsection. If a State determines that the protection and enhancement of the quality of some or all of the waters within the State require greater environmental protection, the State may prohibit one or more such discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. No such prohibition shall apply until the Administrator determines that adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal of the relevant discharges are reasonably available for the waters to which the prohibition would apply. And the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere determines that such prohibition does not create an undue burden on Commerce. The Governor of any State may submit a petition requesting that the Commandant review the regulations promulgated under subsection (a) if there is significant new information, not available previously, that could reasonably result in a change to the regulation. The petition shall be accompanied by the scientific and technical information on which the petition is based. Certain Discharges Unaffected. Nothing this section shall be interpreted to apply to a vessel of the Armed Forces, a discharge of vessel sewage. Or any discharge not subject to the permit exclusion contained in section 122.3(a) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on March 29, 2005. Exclusions.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Improved Budget Presentation Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> PURPOSE. The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission which will submit findings and recommendations to provide a more effective presentation of capital and operating expenses of the United States Government. <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: The Federal Government does not take a comprehensive look at capital investment programs across agency and program lines to see how they fit into a national strategy for maintaining and improving the Nation's public facilities. Both the executive branch and the Congress tend to set priorities for physical capital investment program-by-program. There is no consistent basis for setting priorities among projects and programs, and there is no framework in which to identify those having similar objectives and those that are at cross-purposes. This program- and project-orientation makes planning for public facilities vulnerable to short-term factors, thus impairing the stability and predictability needed for an efficient capital investment program. A separate capital budget would establish a useful planning process because it would focus on long-term projects, costs, and benefits. <SECTION-HEADER> COMMISSION ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES. Establishment. To carry out the purpose of section 2, there is established the Commission on the Presentation of the Budget of the United States . Membership.

Members of the Commission shall not receive compensation for their service on the Commission, but shall be reimbursed by the Federal organization in which they are employed for travel, subsistence, and other necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties on the Commission. <SECTION-HEADER> DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION. In General. The Commission shall study and investigate the manner in which all departments, agencies, independent establishments, and instrumentalities of the United States Government participate in the formulation and presentation of the United States Budget. And make such recommendations as the members of the Commission consider appropriate to provide improved governmental processes in the formulation, presentation, and implementation of the United States Budget with respect to the ability of the United States Budget to distinguish between capital activities and operating activities, and between operating funds and trust funds, to identify the resources needed to meet the Government's needs. Improved procedures among departments, agencies, independent establishments, and instrumentalities of the United States Government to provide improved coordination and control with respect to the formulation, presentation, and implementation of the United States Budget.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> KOREA VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM. Congressional Findings. The Congress finds that travel and tourism play a major role in reducing the United States unfavorable balance of trade. The characteristics of the Korean travel market do not permit long-term planning for longer trips. Applications for United States visas cannot now be processed in a reasonable period of time. The Secretary of State has attempted to solve the problem by adding additional staff to the consular section at the United States Embassy in Seoul. Unfortunately, these additions have not resulted in any discernable improvement in reducing visa processing delays. Further, it is unlikely, given the current fiscal environment, to expect funding to be available for further staff additions in sufficient numbers to effect any significant improvement in the time required to process visa applications. Most of the nations of the South Pacific, Europe, and Canada do not currently require Koreans entering their countries to have a visa, thus providing them with a serious competitive advantage in the tourism industry. The United States territory of Guam has been permitted by the United States Government to eliminate visa requirements for Koreans visiting Guam, with resultant impressive increases in travel and tourism from citizens of the Republic of Korea. Any application under existing procedures to add the Republic of Korea, or any other nation to the group of favored nations exempted from United States visa regulations, would require many years during which time the United States could well lose its competitive advantages in attracting travel and tourism from the Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea, as a gesture of goodwill, has already unilaterally exempted United States tourists who seek to enter the Republic of Korea from the requirement of obtaining a visa. And growth in Korean travel to the United States has not kept pace with growth in travel to non-United States destinations, and cumbersome and time-consuming visa processing procedures are widely recognized as the cause of this loss of market share and competitiveness with alternative destinations. Pilot Program. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General jointly shall establish a pilot project within six months of the date of the enactment of this Act under which the requirement of paragraph (7)(B)(i)(II) of section 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USC. 1182(a)(7)(B)(i)(II)) is waived during the pilot program period in the case of any alien who meets the following requirements: National of pilot program country. The alien is a national of, and presents a passport issued by, the Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea is urged to provide machine readable passports to its citizens in the near future. Seeking entry as tourist. The alien is applying for admission to the United States during the pilot program period as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure (as described in section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USC. 1101(a)(15)(B))), as part of a group tour to the United States. Period of stay. The alien seeks to stay in the United States for a period of not more than 15 days. Executes immigration forms. The alien before the time of such admission completes such immigration form as the Attorney General shall establish. Entry into the united states. If arriving by sea or air, the alien arrives at the port of entry into the United States on a carrier which has entered into an agreement with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to guarantee transport of the alien out of the United States if the alien is found inadmissible or deportable by an immigration officer. Not a safety threat. The alien has been determined not to represent a threat to the welfare, health, safety, or security of the United States. No previous violation. If the alien previously was admitted without a visa under this section, the alien must not have failed to comply with the conditions of any previous admission as such a nonimmigrant. Round-trip ticket. The alien is in possession of a round-trip transportation ticket . Waiver of Rights. An alien may not be provided a waiver under the pilot program unless the alien has waived any right to review or appeal under this Act of an immigration officer's determination as to the admissibility of the alien at the port of entry into the United States, or to contest, other than on the basis of an application for asylum, any action for deportation against the alien. Termination of Authority. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, acting jointly, may terminate the pilot program under this section on or after a date which is one year after the date of the establishment of the pilot program if during the preceding fiscal year, the overstay rate for nationals of the Republic of Korea entering the United States under the pilot program exceeds the overstay rate of such nationals entering the United States with valid visas. And the Attorney General and the Secretary of State have jointly determined that the pilot program is leading to a significant increase in the number of overstays by such nationals. Special Bond and Notification Requirements for Tour Operators. In general. Nationals of the Republic of Korea may not enter the United States under the terms of this section unless they are accompanied for the duration of their authorized admission period by a tour operator who has fulfilled the following requirements: The tour operator has posted a bond of $200,000 with the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State, under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, has approved an application by the tour operator to escort tour groups to the United States. The tour operator provides the name, address, birthdate, passport number, and citizenship of all prospective tour group members to the Secretary of State no less than one business day prior to the departure date of the group, under such regulations as he may prescribe, in order to determine that the prospective travelers do not represent a threat to the welfare, health, safety, and security of the United States. The tour operator excludes from the tour group any person whom the Secretary of State denies permission to travel to the United States. The tour operator provides written certification or other such evidence prescribed by the Secretary of State and Attorney General which documents the return to Korea of each tour group member. Forfeiture of bonds. Bonds posted in accordance with this subsection shall be forfeited in whole or in part and a tour operator's authorization to escort tours to the United States may be suspended or revoked if the Secretary of State finds that the tour operator has failed to disclose a material fact in connection with the application required under paragraph (1)(B). Fails to comply with the advance notification and refusal requirements of paragraphs (1)(C) and (D). Has failed to take adequate steps to ensure that visitors who are being escorted to the United States under the terms of an approved application return to their country of residence. Or is found at any time to have committed a felony or any offense under the immigration laws of the United States. Participation by Tour Agents. The Secretary of State shall periodically review the overstay rate of nationals of the Republic of Korea that corresponds to each tour agent participating in the program under this section. The Secretary may terminate the participation in the program of any tour agent if the Secretary determines that the corresponding overstay rate is excessive. Definitions. For purposes of this section Group tour. The term \"group tour\" means travelers who take advantage of group-purchased hotel or airfare packages, as guided, supervised, and arranged by a tour agent in the Republic of Korea approved or licensed by the Department of State. Overstay rate. The term \"overstay rate\" means, during a specified period of time, the proportion that the number of aliens remaining in the United States after the expiration of their visas bears to the total number of aliens entering the United States during that period of time. Pilot program period. The term \"pilot program period\" means the three-year period immediately following the establishment of the pilot program.","summary":"Directs the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to jointly establish a visa waiver pilot program for Korean nationals traveling in tour groups to the United States.

{"source":"<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Genomic Science and Technology Innovation Act of 2002\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: Genomic science promises a revolution in the development of new and effective genomic technologies and other innovations, and it is in the national interest to speed the development and deployment of these new technologies through policies that promote innovation in the field of genomic science and technology. While Federal innovation policies can help stimulate innovation by attracting capital investment to the development of commercial products, such policies can also inhibit basic research and hinder sharing of information that is the basis of scientific progress, thereby slowing the innovation process. Intellectual property policies for genomic science and technology products are being implemented without an adequate understanding and consideration of the net impact of such policies on the innovation process. Decisions about intellectual property policy being made now are likely to have significant impacts on basic research and the development of genomic technology for decades to come. The Office of Science and Technology Policy is uniquely positioned to lead the development of a coordinated, interagency policy to promote innovation in genomic science and technology. A definitive study coordinated by the Office of Science and Technology Policy that identifies the impacts of Federal innovation policy on the innovation pipeline for genomic technology and includes recommendations for policies, including any statutory changes needed to optimize the genomic technology innovation pipeline, would contribute significantly to the development of the policy. <SECTION-HEADER> STUDY.

Contents. The study shall identify and quantify, to extent possible, the actual and reasonably expected effects of innovation policy on genomic science and technology innovation. Explicitly consider various alternative levels of intellectual property protection genomic materials may receive and the likely impact of the various levels of protection on each element of the innovation pipeline, including fundamental genomic research carried out at universities and other nonprofit research institutions. Commercial genomic research at universities, nonprofit research institutions, and for-profit institutions, including the expected effects on intracompany investment and external private capital. Development of commercial genomic technologies, including the expected effects on investment capital, and access to genomic technologies and processes. And include an assessment of the net impact of Federal innovation policies on innovation for genomic technologies, including an assessment of researchers' access to genomic materials, the rate of innovation, the quality of innovation, the cost of new genomic technologies brought to market. The impact of restricted access to genomic diagnostics on evaluation, improvement, and clinical utilization, the cost and availability of innovative technology. Whether Federal innovation policies create barriers to research through denial of use of a research tool, increased costs of licensing, legal and litigation costs, transaction costs, or the perception of increased legal liability, or hinder the access of researchers to genomic materials and to databases of genomic sequence information. Whether Federal innovation policies affect the choice of area of research conducted by researchers or institutions or provide positive benefits to such research, including additional funding from private sector partners. And the range of incentives providing motivation for genetics research and technology development other than intellectual property protection. <SECTION-HEADER> REPORT. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall, within 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, transmit a report to Congress that contains the findings of the study conducted under section 3.

The Manufacturing Extension Partnership has delivered $1.44 billion in cost savings annually and $10.5 billion in increased or retained sales in a single year. Every dollar contributed by the Federal Government to the Manufacturing Extension Partnership is matched 2-to-1 by State and local governments and participating manufacturers. The recession has strained many State budgets, and 23 State Manufacturing Extension Partnership Centers reported a decrease or elimination of State funding in 2009. When a State decreases or eliminates funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the cost-share burden is shifted to small manufacturers who are unlikely to be able to afford increased contributions during an economic downturn, and the availability of Manufacturing Extension Partnership services is jeopardized. A reduction in the matching requirement for participants in the Manufacturing Extension Partnership will greatly alleviate the burden on State budgets and small manufacturers and preserve the Manufacturing Extension Partnership's ability to provide critical services to small manufacturers and create much-needed jobs in the manufacturing sector. <SECTION-HEADER> HOLLINGS MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM.
